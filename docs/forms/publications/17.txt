differing interpretations are resolved by higher court 
decisions or in some other way, this publication will 
continue to present the interpretations by the IRS.
All taxpayers have important rights when working with 
the IRS. These rights are described in Your Rights as a

What's New
This section summarizes important 
tax changes that took effect in 
2022. Most of these changes are 
discussed 
in 
more 
detail 
throughout this publication.
Future developments. For the 
latest information about the tax law 
topics covered in this publication, 
such as legislation enacted after it 
was published, go to IRS.gov/
Pub17.
Due date of return. File Form 
1040 or 1040-SR by April 18, 2023. 
The due date is April 18, instead of 
April 15, because of the Emancipa-
tion Day holiday in the District of 
Columbia even if you don't live in 
the District of Columbia. See chap-
ter 1, later.
Filing status name changed to 
qualifying 
surviving 
spouse. 
The 
filing 
status 
qualifying 
widow(er) is now called qualifying 
surviving spouse. The rules for the 
filing status have not changed. The 
same rules that applied for qualify-
ing widow(er) apply to qualifying 
surviving spouse.
Who must file.  Generally, the 
amount of income you can receive 
before you must file a return has 
been increased. For more informa-
tion, see chapter 1, later.
Standard deduction amount in-
creased. For 2022, the standard 
deduction amount has been in-
creased for all filers. The amounts 
are:
•
Single or Married filing sepa-
rately—$12,950;
•
Married filing jointly or Qualify-
ing surviving 
spouse—$25,900; and
•
Head of household—$19,400.
See chapter 10, later.
New lines 1a through 1z on 
Form 1040 and 1040-SR.  This 
year, line 1 is expanded and there 
are new lines 1a through 1z. Some 
amounts that in prior years were 
reported on Form 1040, and some 
amounts 
reported 
on 
Form 
1040-SR are now reported on 
Schedule 1.
•
Scholarships and fellowship 
grants are now reported on 
Schedule 1, line 8r.
•
Pension or annuity from a 
nonqualified deferred com-
pensation plan or a nongo-
vernmental section 457 plan 
are now reported on Schedule 
1, line 8t.
•
Wages earned while incarcer-
ated are now reported on 
Schedule 1, line 8u.
New line 6c on Form 1040 and 
1040-SR. A checkbox was added 
on line 6c. Taxpayers who elect to 
use the lump-sum election method 
for their benefits will check this 
box. See Instructions for Form 
1040.
Credits for sick and family leave 
for certain self-employed indi-
viduals are not available. The 
credit for sick and family leave for 
certain self-employed individuals 
were not extended and you can no 
longer claim these credits.
Health coverage tax credit is 
not available. The health cover-
age tax credit was not extended. 
The credit is not available after 
2021.
Credit for child and dependent 
care expenses.  The changes to 
the credit for child and dependent 
care expenses implemented by the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 
(ARP) were not extended. For 
2022, the credit for the child and 
dependent care expenses is non-
refundable. The dollar limit on qual-
ifying expenses is $3,000 for one 
qualifying person and $6,000 for 
two or more qualifying persons. 
The maximum credit amount al-
lowed is 35% of your employ-
ment-related expenses. For more 
information, see the Instructions for 
Form 2441 and Pub. 503.
Child tax credit enhancements 
have expired. Many changes to 
the CTC for 2021 implemented by 
the American Rescue Plan Act of 
2021 have expired. For tax year 
2022:
•
The enhanced credit allowed 
for qualifying children under 
age 6 and children under age 
18 has expired. For 2022, the 
initial amount of the CTC is 
$2,000 for each qualifying 
child. The credit amount be-
gins to phase out where modi-
fied adjusted gross income 
exceeds $200,000 ($400,000 
in the case of a joint return). 
The amount of the CTC that 
can be claimed as a refunda-
ble credit is limited as it was in 
2020 except that the maxi-
mum ACTC amount for each 
qualifying child increased to 
$1,500.
•
The increased age allowance 
for a qualifying child has ex-
pired. A child must be under 
age 17 at the end of 2022 to 
be a qualifying child.
For more information, see the In-
structions for Schedule 8812 (Form 
1040).
ACTC and bona fide residents 
of Puerto Rico. Bona fide resi-
dents of Puerto Rico are no longer 
required to have three or more 
qualifying children to be eligible to 
claim the ACTC. Bona fide resi-
dents of Puerto Rico may be eligi-
ble to claim the ACTC if they have 
one or more qualifying children.
Advance child tax credit pay-
ments.  Advance child tax credit 
payments have not been issued for 
2022.
Delayed 
refund 
for 
returns 
claiming ACTC. The IRS cannot 
issue refunds before mid-February 
2023 for returns that properly claim 
ACTC. This time frame applies to 
the entire refund, not just the por-
tion associated with ACTC.
Changes to the earned income 
credit (EIC). The enhancements 
for taxpayers without a qualifying 
child implemented by ARP don't 
apply for 2022. This means, to 
claim the EIC without a qualifying 
child in 2022, you must be at least 
age 25 but under age 65 at the end 
of 2022. If you are married filing a 
joint return, either you or your 
spouse must be at least age 25 but 
under age 65 at the end of 2022. It 
doesn't 
matter 
which 
spouse 
meets the age requirement, as 
long as one of the spouses does.
Nontaxable 
Medicaid 
waiver 
payments on Schedule 1.  In 
2021, the nontaxable amount of 
Medicaid waiver payments were 
reported on Schedule 1, line 8z. In 
2022, these amounts will be repor-
ted on Schedule 1, line 8s.
Nontaxable combat pay elec-
tion.  In 2021, the amount of your 
nontaxable combat pay was repor-
ted on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, 
line 27b. In 2022, these amounts 
will be reported on Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, line 1i.
Standard 
mileage 
rate. The 
2022 rate for business use of a ve-
hicle is 58.5 cents a mile from Jan-
uary 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022, and 
62.5 cents a mile from July 1, 2022 
to December 31, 2022. The 2022 
rate for use of your vehicle to do 
volunteer work for certain charita-
ble organizations is 14 cents a mile 
from January 1, 2022 to December 
31, 2022. The 2022 rate for operat-
ing expenses for a car when you 
use it for medical reasons are 18 
cents a mile from January 1, 2022 
to June 30, 2022, and 22 cents a 
mile from July 1, 2022 to Decem-
ber 31, 2022.
Modified AGI limit for traditional 
IRA contributions. For 2022, if 
you are covered by a retirement 
plan at work, your deduction for 
contributions to a traditional IRA is 
reduced (phased out) if your modi-
fied AGI is:
•
More than $109,000 but less 
than $129,000 for a married 
couple filing a joint return or a 
qualifying surviving spouse,
•
More than $68,000 but less 
than $78,000 for a single indi-
vidual or head of household, 
or
•
Less than $10,000 for a mar-
ried individual filing a separate 
return.
If you either live with your spouse 
or file a joint return, and your 
spouse is covered by a retirement 
plan at work but you aren't, your 
deduction is phased out if your 
modified 
AGI 
is 
more 
than 
$204,000 but less than $214,000. If 
your modified AGI is $214,000 or 
more, you can't take a deduction 
for contributions to a traditional 
IRA. See How Much Can You De-
duct in chapter 9, later.
Modified AGI limit for Roth IRA 
contributions.  For 2022, your 
Roth IRA contribution limit is re-
duced (phased out) in the following 
situations.
•
Your filing status is married fil-
ing jointly or qualifying surviv-
ing spouse and your modified 
AGI is at least $204,000. You 
can't make a Roth IRA contri-
bution if your modified AGI is 
$214,000 or more.
•
Your filing status is single, 
head of household, or married 
filing separately and you didn't 
live with your spouse at any 
time in 2022 and your modi-
fied AGI is at least $129,000. 
You can't make a Roth IRA 
contribution if your modified 
AGI is $144,000 or more.
•
Your filing status is married fil-
ing separately, you lived with 
your spouse at any time dur-
ing the year, and your modi-
fied AGI is more than zero. 
You can't make a Roth IRA 
contribution if your modified 
AGI is $10,000 or more. See 
Can You Contribute to a Roth 
IRA in chapter 9, later.
2023 modified AGI limits. You 
can find information about the 
2023 contribution and modified 
AGI limits in Pub. 590-A.

estimated tax, consider tax law 
changes effective in 2023. For 
more information, see Pub. 505, 
Tax Withholding and Estimated 
Tax.
Alternative minimum tax (AMT) 
exemption amount increased. 
The AMT exemption amount is in-
creased to $75,900 ($118,100 if 
married filing jointly or qualifying 
surviving spouse; $59,050 if mar-
ried filing separately). The income 
levels at which the AMT exemption 
begins to phase out have in-
creased to $539,900 ($1,079,800 if 
married filing jointly or qualifying 
surviving spouse).
Adoption credit. The adoption 
credit and the exclusion for em-
ployer-provided adoption benefits 
have both increased to $15,950 
per eligible child in 2022. The 
amount begins to phase out if you 
have modified AGI in excess of 
$239,230 
and 
is 
completely 
phased out if your modified AGI is 
$279,230 or more.
Reporting 
requirements 
for 
Form 1099-K. Form 1099-K is is-
sued by third party settlement or-
ganizations and credit card compa-
nies to report payment transactions 
made to you for goods and serv-
ices.
You must report all income on 
your tax return unless excluded by 
law, whether you received the in-
come electronically or not, and 
whether you received a Form 
1099-K or not. The box 1a and 
other amounts reported on Form 
1099-K are additional pieces of in-
formation to help determine the 
correct amounts to report on your 
return.
If you received a Form 1099-K 
that shows payments you didn’t re-
ceive or is otherwise incorrect, 
contact the Form 1099-K issuer. 
Don’t contact the IRS; the IRS can’t 
correct an incorrect Form 1099-K. 
If you can’t get it corrected, or you 
sold a personal item at a loss, see 
the instructions for Schedule 1, 
lines 8z and 24z, later, for more re-
porting information.
All IRS information about Form 
1099-K is available by going to 
IRS.gov/1099K.
Reminders
Listed 
below 
are 
important 
reminders and other items that 
may help you file your 2022 tax 
return. Many of these items are 
explained in more detail later in this 
publication.
Publication 17 changes. We re-
moved the following 2019 chapters 
from this publication: 6, 8, 9, 10, 
13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 
25, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, and 
36. You can find most of the infor-
mation previously found in those 
chapters in the primary publication. 
Please 
see 
Publication 
17 
changes, later.
Special rules for eligible gains 
invested in Qualified Opportu-
nity Funds. If you have an eligible 
gain, you can invest that gain into a 
Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) 
and elect to defer part or all of the 
gain that is otherwise includible in 
income. The gain is deferred until 
the date you sell or exchange the 
investment or December 31, 2026, 
whichever is earlier. You may also 
be able to permanently exclude 
gain from the sale or exchange of 
an investment in a QOF if the in-
vestment is held for at least 10 
years. For information about what 
types of gains entitle you to elect 
these special rules, see the In-
structions for Schedule D (Form 
1040). For information on how to 
elect to use these special rules, 
see the Instructions for Form 8949.
Secure your tax records from 
identity theft. Identity theft occurs 
when someone uses your personal 
information, such as your name, 
SSN, or other identifying informa-
tion, without your permission, to 
commit fraud or other crimes. An 
identity thief may use your SSN to 
get a job or may file a tax return us-
ing your SSN to receive a refund. 
For more information about identity 
theft and how to reduce your risk 
from it, see chapter 1, later.
Taxpayer 
identification 
num-
bers. You must provide the tax-
payer identification number for 
each person for whom you claim 
certain tax benefits. This applies 
even if the person was born in 
2022. Generally, this number is the 
person's SSN. See chapter 1, later.
Tuition and fees deduction not 
available. The tuition and fees de-
duction is not available after 2020. 
Instead, the income limitations for 
the lifetime learning credit have 
been increased. See Form 8863 
and its instructions.
Premium tax credit (PTC). The 
ARP expanded the PTC by elimi-
nating the limitation that a taxpay-
er's household income may not ex-
ceed 400% of the federal poverty 
line and generally increases the 
credit amounts. For more informa-
tion, see Pub. 974 and Form 8962 
and its instructions.
Identity 
verification. The 
IRS 
launched an improved identity veri-
fication and sign-in process that 
enables more people to securely 
access and use IRS online tools 
and applications. To provide verifi-
cation services, the IRS is using 
ID.me, a trusted technology pro-
vider. The new process is one 
more step the IRS is taking to en-
sure that taxpayer information is 
provided only to the person who le-
gally has a right to the data. Tax-
payers 
using 
the 
new 
mo-
bile-friendly verification procedure 
can gain entry to existing IRS on-
line services such as the Child Tax 
Credit Update Portal, On-line Ac-
count, Get Transcript Online, Get 
an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN), 
and Online Payment Agreement. 
Additional IRS applications will 
transition to the new method over 
the next year. Each online service 
will also provide information that 
will instruct taxpayers on the steps 
they need to follow for access to 
the service. You can also see 
IR-2021-228 for more information.
Form 
1040-X 
continuous-use 
form 
and 
instructions. Form 
1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual 
Income Tax Return, and its instruc-
tions have been converted from an 
annual revision to continuous use 
beginning in tax year 2021. Both 
the form and instructions will be 
updated as required. For the most 
recent version, go to IRS.gov/
Form1040X. Section discussions 
and charts that were updated an-
nually have been removed, or re-
placed with references to relevant 
forms, schedules, instructions, and 
publications. 
See 
the 
forms, 
schedules, instructions, and publi-
cations for the year of the tax re-
turn you are amending for guid-
ance on specific topics.
Business meals. Section 210 of 
the Taxpayer Certainty and Disas-
ter Tax Relief Act of 2020 provides 
for the temporary allowance of a 
100% business meal deduction for 
food or beverages provided by a 
restaurant and paid or incurred af-
ter December 31, 2020, and before 
January 1, 2023.
Foreign-source income. If you 
are a U.S. citizen with income from 
sources outside the United States 
(foreign income), you must report 
all such income on your tax return 
unless it is exempt by law or a tax 
treaty. This is true whether you live 
inside or outside the United States 
and whether or not you receive a 
Form W-2 or Form 1099 from the 
foreign payer. This applies to 
earned income (such as wages 
and tips) as well as unearned in-
come (such as interest, dividends, 
capital gains, pensions, rents, and 
royalties).
If you live outside the United 
States, you may be able to exclude 
part or all of your foreign earned in-
come. For details, see Pub. 54, 
Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and 
Resident Aliens Abroad.
Foreign financial assets. If you 
had foreign financial assets in 
2022, you may have to file Form 
8938 with your return. See Form 
8938 and its instructions or visit 
IRS.gov/Form8938 for details.
Automatic 6-month extension to 
file tax return. You can get an au-
tomatic 6-month extension of time 
to file your tax return. See chap-
ter 1, later.
Payment of taxes. You can pay 
your taxes by making electronic 
payments online; from a mobile de-
vice using the IRS2Go app; or in 
cash, or by check or money order. 
Paying 
electronically 
is 
quick, 
easy, and faster than mailing in a 
check or money order. See chap-
ter 1, later.
Faster ways to file your return. 
The IRS offers fast, accurate ways 
to file your tax return information 
without filing a paper tax return. 
You can use IRS e-file (electronic 
filing). See chapter 1, later.
Free electronic filing. You may 
be able to file your 2022 taxes on-
line for free. See chapter 1, later.
Change 
of 
address. If 
you 
change your address, notify the 
IRS. See chapter 1, later.
Refund on a late-filed return. If 
you were due a refund but you did 
not file a return, you must generally 
file your return within 3 years from 
the date the return was due (in-
cluding extensions) to get that re-
fund. See chapter 1, later.
Frivolous tax returns. The IRS 
has published a list of positions 
that are identified as frivolous. The 
penalty for filing a frivolous tax re-
turn is $5,000. See chapter 1, later.
Filing erroneous claim for re-
fund or credit. You may have to 
pay a penalty if you file an errone-
ous claim for refund or credit. See 
chapter 1, later.
Access your online account. 
You must authenticate your iden-
tity. To securely log into your fed-
eral tax account, go to IRS.gov/
Account. View the amount you 
Page 2
Publication 17 (2022)

owe, review last 5 years of pay-
ment history, access online pay-
ment options, and create or modify 
an online payment agreement. You 
can also access your tax records 
online.
Health care coverage. If you 
need health care coverage, go to 
HealthCare.gov to learn about 
health insurance options for you 
and your family, how to buy health 
insurance, and how you might 
qualify to get financial assistance 
to buy health insurance.
Disclosure, Privacy Act, and pa-
perwork reduction information. 
The IRS Restructuring and Reform 
Act of 1998, the Privacy Act of 
1974, and the Paperwork Reduc-
tion Act of 1980 require that when 
we ask you for information, we 
must first tell you what our legal 
right is to ask for the information, 
why we are asking for it, how it will 
be used, what could happen if we 
do not receive it, and whether your 
response is voluntary, required to 
obtain a benefit, or mandatory un-
der the law. A complete statement 
on this subject can be found in 
your tax form instructions.
Preparer e-file mandate. Most 
paid preparers must e-file returns 
they prepare and file. Your pre-
parer may make you aware of this 
requirement and the options avail-
able to you.
Treasury Inspector General for 
Tax Administration. If you want 
to confidentially report misconduct, 
waste, fraud, or abuse by an IRS 
employee, 
you 
can 
call 
800-366-4484 (call 800-877-8339 
if you are deaf, hard of hearing, or 
have a speech disability, and are 
using TTY/TDD equipment). You 
can remain anonymous.
Photographs of missing chil-
dren. The IRS is a proud partner 
with 
the 
National 
Center 
for 
Missing & Exploited Children® 
(NCMEC). Photographs of missing 
children selected by the Center 
may appear in this publication on 
pages that would otherwise be 
blank. You can help bring these 
children home by looking at the 
photographs 
and 
calling 
1-800-THE-LOST (800-843-5678) 
if you recognize a child.

Introduction
This publication covers the general 
rules for filing a federal income tax 
return. It supplements the informa-
tion contained in your tax form in-
structions. It explains the tax law to 
make sure you pay only the tax you 
owe and no more.
How this publication is ar-
ranged. Pub. 17 closely follows 
Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income 
Tax Return, and Form 1040-SR, 
U.S. Tax Return for Seniors, and 
their three Schedules 1 through 3. 
Pub. 17 is divided into four parts. 
Each part is further divided into 
chapters, most of which generally 
discuss one line of the form or one 
line of one of the three schedules. 
The introduction at the beginning 
of each part lists the schedule(s) 
discussed in that part.
The table of contents inside the 
front cover, the introduction to 
each part, and the index in the 
back of the publication are useful 
tools to help you find the informa-
tion you need.
What is in this publication. This 
publication begins with the rules for 
filing a tax return. It explains:
1. Who must file a return,
2. When the return is due,
3. How to e-file your return, and
4. Other general information.
It will help you identify which filing 
status you qualify for, whether you 
can claim any dependents, and 
whether the income you receive is 
taxable. The publication goes on to 
explain the standard deduction, the 
kinds of expenses you may be able 
to deduct, and the various kinds of 
credits you may be able to take to 
reduce your tax.
Throughout this publication are 
examples showing how the tax law 
applies in typical situations. Also 
throughout this publication are 
flowcharts and tables that present 
tax information in an easy-to-un-
derstand manner.
Many of the subjects discussed 
in this publication are discussed in 
greater detail in other IRS publica-
tions. References to those other 
publications are provided for your 
information.
Icons. Small graphic symbols, 
or icons, are used to draw your at-
tention to special information. See 
Table 1 for an explanation of each

Part One.
The Income Tax 
Return
The four chapters in this part provide basic information on the tax system. 
They take you through the first steps of filling out a tax return. They also 
provide information about dependents, and discuss recordkeeping 
requirements, IRS e-file (electronic filing), certain penalties, and the two 
methods used to pay tax during the year: withholding and estimated tax.
The Form 1040 and 1040-SR schedules that are discussed in these 
chapters are:
• Schedule 1, Additional Income and Adjustments to Income; and
• Schedule 3 (Part II), Other Payments and Refundable Credits.
1.
Filing 
Information
What's New
Due date of return.  File Form 1040 or 
1040-SR by April 18, 2023. The due date is 
April 18, instead of April 15, because of the 
Emancipation Day holiday in the District of Co-
lumbia—even if you don't live in the District of 
Columbia.
Filing status name changed to qualifying 
surviving spouse. The filing status qualifying 
widow(er) is now called qualifying surviving 
spouse. The rules for the filing status have not 
changed. The same rules that applied for quali-
fying widow(er) apply to qualifying surviving 
spouse. See chapter 2 for information on filing 
status.
New lines 1a through 1z on Form 1040 and 
1040-SR. This year line 1 is expanded and 
there are new lines 1a through 1z.
New lines on Schedule 1. This year there are 
new lines 8r through 8u.
Who must file. Generally, the amount of in-
come you can receive before you must file a re-
turn has been increased. See Table 1-1, Ta-
ble 1-2, and Table 1-3 for the specific amounts.
Reminders

per, you may be able to file electronically using 
IRS e-file. For more information, see Why 
Should I File Electronically, later.

tra time to take care of your tax matters if you 
are a member of the Armed Forces who served 
in a combat zone, or if you served in a combat 
zone in support of the Armed Forces. See Indi-
viduals Serving in Combat Zone, later, under 
When Do I Have To File.
Adoption taxpayer identification number. If 
a child has been placed in your home for purpo-
ses of legal adoption and you won't be able to 
get a social security number for the child in time 
to file your return, you may be able to get an 
adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN). 
For more information, see Social Security Num-
ber (SSN), later.
Taxpayer identification number for aliens. 
If you or your dependent is a nonresident or res-
ident alien who doesn't have and isn't eligible to 
get a social security number, file Form W-7, Ap-
plication for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identifica-
tion Number, with the IRS. For more informa-
tion, see Social Security Number (SSN), later.
Individual taxpayer identification number 
(ITIN) renewal. Some ITINs must be renewed. 
If you haven't used your ITIN on a U.S. tax re-
turn at least once for tax years 2019, 2020, or 
2021, it expired at the end of 2022 and must be 
renewed if you need to file a U.S. federal tax re-
turn in 2023. You don't need to renew your ITIN 
if you don't need to file a federal tax return. You 
can find more information at IRS.gov/ITIN.
ITINs assigned before 2013 have ex-
pired and must be renewed if you need 
to file a tax return in 2023. If you previ-
ously submitted a renewal application and it 
was approved, you do not need to renew again 
unless you haven't used your ITIN on a federal 
tax return at least once for tax years 2019, 
2020, or 2021.
Frivolous tax submissions. The IRS has 
published a list of positions that are identified as 
frivolous. The penalty for filing a frivolous tax re-
turn is $5,000. Also, the $5,000 penalty will ap-
ply to other specified frivolous submissions. For 
more information, see Civil Penalties, later.

Do I Have To
File a Return?
You must file a federal income tax return if you 
are a citizen or resident of the United States or 
a resident of Puerto Rico and you meet the filing 
requirements for any of the following categories 
that apply to you.
1. Individuals in general. (There are special 
rules for individuals whose spouse has 
died, executors, administrators, legal rep-
resentatives, U.S. citizens and residents 
living outside the United States, residents 
of Puerto Rico, and individuals with in-
come from U.S. possessions.)
2. Dependents.
3. Certain children under age 19 or full-time 
students.
4. Self-employed persons.
5. Aliens.
The filing requirements for each category are 
explained in this chapter.
The filing requirements apply even if you 
don't owe tax.
Even if you don't have to file a return, it 
may be to your advantage to do so. 
See Who Should File, later.
File only one federal income tax return 
for the year regardless of how many 
jobs you had, how many Forms W-2 
you received, or how many states you lived in 
during the year. Don't file more than one original 
return for the same year, even if you haven’t re-
ceived your refund or haven’t heard from the 
IRS since you filed.
Individuals—In General
If you are a U.S. citizen or resident, whether you 
must file a return depends on three factors.
1. Your gross income.
2. Your filing status.
3. Your age.
To find out whether you must file, see Ta-
ble 1-1, Table 1-2, and Table 1-3. Even if no ta-
ble shows that you must file, you may need to 
file to get money back. See Who Should File, 
later.
Gross income. This includes all income you 
receive in the form of money, goods, property, 
and services that isn't exempt from tax. It also 
includes income from sources outside the Uni-
ted States or from the sale of your main home 
TIP
CAUTION
!
(even if you can exclude all or part of it). Include 
part of your social security benefits if:
1. You were married, filing a separate return, 
and you lived with your spouse at any time 
during 2022; or
2. Half of your social security benefits plus 
your other gross income and any tax-ex-
empt interest is more than $25,000 
($32,000 if married filing jointly).
If either (1) or (2) applies, see the Instructions 
for Form 1040 or Pub. 915 to figure the social 
security benefits you must include in gross in-
come.
Common types of income are discussed in 
Part Two of this publication.
Community property states. Community 
property states include Arizona, California, 
Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, 
Washington, and Wisconsin. If you and your 
spouse lived in a community property state, you 
must usually follow state law to determine what 
is community property and what is separate in-
come. For details, see Form 8958 and Pub. 
555.
Nevada, Washington, and California do-
mestic partners. A registered domestic part-
ner in Nevada, Washington, or California must 
generally report half the combined community 
income of the individual and their domestic part-
ner. See Pub. 555.
Self-employed 
individuals. If 
you 
are 
self-employed, your gross income includes the 
amount on line 7 of Schedule C (Form 1040), 
Profit or Loss From Business; and line 9 of 
Schedule F (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From 
Farming. See Self-Employed Persons, later, for 
more information about your filing requirements.
If you don't report all of your self-em-
ployment income, your social security 
benefits may be lower when you retire.
Filing status. Your filing status depends on 
whether you are single or married and on your 
family situation. Your filing status is determined 
on the last day of your tax year, which is De-
cember 31 for most taxpayers. See chapter 2 
for an explanation of each filing status.
Age. If you are 65 or older at the end of the 
year, you can generally have a higher amount 
of gross income than other taxpayers before 
you must file. See Table 1-1. You are consid-
ered 65 on the day before your 65th birthday. 
For example, if your 65th birthday is on January 
1, 2023, you are considered 65 for 2022.
Surviving Spouses,
Executors, Administrators,
and Legal Representatives
You must file a final return for a decedent (a 
person who died) if both of the following are 
true.
•
Your spouse died in 2022 or you are the 
executor, administrator, or legal represen-
tative.
•
The decedent met the filing requirements 
at the date of death.

If you were born on January 1, 1958, you are considered to be age 65 at the end of 2022. (If your spouse 
died in 2022 or if you are preparing a return for someone who died in 2022, see Pub. 501.)
**
Gross income means all income you received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that 
isn't exempt from tax, including any income from sources outside the United States or from the sale of 
your main home (even if you can exclude part or all of it). Don't include any social security benefits unless 
(a) you are married filing a separate return and you lived with your spouse at any time during 2022, or (b) 
one-half of your social security benefits plus your other gross income and any tax-exempt interest is more 
than $25,000 ($32,000 if married filing jointly). If (a) or (b) applies, see the Instructions for Form 1040 or 
Pub. 915 to figure the taxable part of social security benefits you must include in gross income. Gross 
income includes gains, but not losses, reported on Form 8949 or Schedule D. Gross income from a 
business means, for example, the amount on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9. But, in figuring 
gross income, don't reduce your income by any losses, including any loss on Schedule C, line 7, or 
Schedule F, line 9.
***
If you didn't live with your spouse at the end of 2022 (or on the date your spouse died) and your gross 
income was at least $5, you must file a return regardless of your age.
Page 6 Chapter 1 Filing Information

For more information on rules for filing a de-
cedent's final return, see Pub. 559.
U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens 
Living Abroad
To determine whether you must file a return, in-
clude in your gross income any income you re-
ceived abroad, including any income you can 
exclude under the foreign earned income exclu-
sion. For information on special tax rules that 
may apply to you, see Pub. 54. It is available 
online and at most U.S. embassies and consu-
lates. See How To Get Tax Help in the back of 
this publication.
Residents of Puerto Rico
If you are a U.S. citizen and also a bona fide 
resident of Puerto Rico, you must generally file 
a U.S. income tax return for any year in which 
you meet the income requirements. This is in 
addition to any legal requirement you may have 
to file an income tax return with Puerto Rico.
If you are a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico 
for the entire year, your U.S. gross income 
doesn't include income from sources within
Puerto Rico. It does, however, include any in-
come you received for your services as an em-
ployee of the United States or a U.S. agency. If 
you receive income from Puerto Rican sources 
that isn't subject to U.S. tax, you must reduce 
your standard deduction. As a result, the 
amount of income you must have before you 
are required to file a U.S. income tax return is 
lower than the applicable amount in Table 1-1 
or Table 1-2. For more information, see Pub. 
570.
Individuals With Income From
U.S. Possessions
If you had income from Guam, the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Ameri-
can Samoa, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, special 
rules may apply when determining whether you 
must file a U.S. federal income tax return. In ad-
dition, you may have to file a return with the in-
dividual island government. See Pub. 570 for 
more information.
Dependents
If you are a dependent (one who meets the de-
pendency tests in chapter 3), see Table 1-2 to 
find out whether you must file a return. You 
must also file if your situation is described in Ta-
ble 1-3.
Responsibility of parent. Generally, a child is 
responsible for filing their own tax return and for 
paying any tax on the return. If a dependent 
child must file an income tax return but can’t file 
due to age or any other reason, then a parent, 
guardian, or other legally responsible person 
must file it for the child. If the child can’t sign the 
return, the parent or guardian must sign the 
child's name followed by the words “By (your 
signature), parent for minor child.”
Child's earnings. Amounts a child earns by 
performing services are included in the child’s 
gross income and not the gross income of the 
parent. This is true even if under local law the 
child's parent has the right to the earnings and 
may actually have received them. But if the 
child doesn't pay the tax due on this income, 
the parent is liable for the tax.
Certain Children Under 
Age 19 or Full-Time 
Students
If a child's only income is interest and dividends 
(including capital gain distributions and Alaska 
Permanent Fund dividends), the child was un-
der age 19 at the end of 2022 or was a full-time 
student under age 24 at the end of 2022, and 
certain other conditions are met, a parent can 
elect to include the child's income on the pa-
rent's return. If this election is made, the child 
doesn't have to file a return. See Instructions for 
Form 8814, Parents’ Election To Report Child’s 
Interest and Dividends.
Self-Employed Persons
You are self-employed if you:
•
Carry on a trade or business as a sole pro-
prietor,
•
Are an independent contractor,
•
Are a member of a partnership, or
•
Are in business for yourself in any other 
way.
Self-employment can include work in addi-
tion to your regular full-time business activities, 
such as certain part-time work you do at home 
or in addition to your regular job. 
You must file a return if your gross income is 
at least as much as the filing requirement 
amount for your filing status and age (shown in 
Table 1-1). Also, you must file Form 1040 or 
1040-SR and Schedule SE (Form 1040), 
Self-Employment Tax, if:
1. Your net earnings from self-employment 
(excluding church employee income) were 
$400 or more, or
2. You had church employee income of 
$108.28 or more. (See Table 1-3.)
Use Schedule SE (Form 1040) to figure your 
self-employment tax. Self-employment tax is 
comparable to the social security and Medicare 
tax withheld from an employee's wages. For 
more information about this tax, see Pub. 334.
Employees of foreign governments or in-
ternational organizations. If you are a U.S. 
citizen who works in the United States for an in-
ternational organization, a foreign government, 
or a wholly owned instrumentality of a foreign 
government, and your employer isn't required to 
withhold social security and Medicare taxes 
from your wages, you must include your earn-
ings from services performed in the United 
States when figuring your net earnings from 
self-employment.
Ministers. You must include income from 
services you performed as a minister when fig-
uring your net earnings from self-employment, 
unless you have an exemption from self-em-
ployment tax. This also applies to Christian Sci-
ence practitioners and members of a religious 
order who have not taken a vow of poverty. For 
more information, see Pub. 517.
Aliens
Your status as an alien (resident, nonresident, 
or dual-status) determines whether and how 
you must file an income tax return.
The rules used to determine your alien sta-
tus are discussed in Pub. 519.
Resident alien. If you are a resident alien for 
the entire year, you must file a tax return follow-
ing the same rules that apply to U.S. citizens. 
Use the forms discussed in this publication.
Nonresident alien. If you are a nonresident 
alien, the rules and tax forms that apply to you 
are different from those that apply to U.S. citi-
zens and resident aliens. See Pub. 519 to find 
out if U.S. income tax laws apply to you and 
which forms you should file.
Dual-status taxpayer. If you are a resident 
alien for part of the tax year and a nonresident 
alien for the rest of the year, you are a dual-sta-
tus taxpayer. Different rules apply for each part 
of the year. For information on dual-status tax-
payers, see Pub. 519. 
Who Should File
Even if you don't have to file, you should file a 
federal income tax return to get money back if 
any of the following conditions apply.
1. You had federal income tax withheld or 
made estimated tax payments. 
2. You qualify for the earned income credit. 
See Pub. 596 for more information. 
3. You qualify for the additional child tax 
credit. See chapter 14 for more informa-
tion.
4. You qualify for the premium tax credit. See 
Pub. 974 for more information.
5. You qualify for the American opportunity 
credit. See Pub. 970 for more information.
6. You qualify for the credit for federal tax on 
fuels. See chapter 13 for more informa-
tion.
Form 1040 or 1040-SR
Use Form 1040 or 1040-SR to file your return. 
(But also see Why Should I File Electronically, 
later.)
You can use Form 1040 or 1040-SR to re-
port all types of income, deductions, and cred-
its.
Why Should I File 
Electronically?
Electronic Filing
If your adjusted gross income (AGI) is less than 
a certain amount, you are eligible for Free File, 
a free tax software service offered by IRS part-
ners, to prepare and e-file your return for free. If 
your income is over the amount, you are still eli-
gible for Free File Fillable Forms, an electronic 
Chapter 1 Filing Information Page 7

version of IRS paper forms. Table 1-4 lists the 
free ways to electronically file your return.
IRS e-file uses automa-
tion to replace most of the 
manual steps needed to process paper returns. 
As a result, the processing of e-file returns is 
faster and more accurate than the processing of 
paper returns. However, as with a paper return, 
you are responsible for making sure your return 
contains accurate information and is filed on 
time.
If your return is filed with IRS e-file, you will re-
ceive an acknowledgment that your return was 
received and accepted. If you owe tax, you can 
e-file and pay electronically. The IRS has pro-
cessed more than one billion e-filed returns 
safely and securely. Using e-file doesn't affect 
your chances of an IRS examination of your re-
turn.
Requirements for an electronic return sig-
nature. To file your return electronically, you 
must sign the return electronically using a per-
sonal identification number (PIN). If you are fil-
ing online, you must use a Self-Select PIN. For 
2022, if we issued you an identity protection 
personal identification number (IP PIN) (as de-
scribed in more detail below), all six digits of 
your IP PIN must appear in the IP PIN spaces 
provided next to the space for your occupation 
for your electronic signature to be complete. 
Failure to include an issued IP PIN on the elec-
tronic return will result in an invalid signature 
and a rejected return. If you are filing a joint re-
turn and both taxpayers were issued an IP PIN, 
enter both IP PINs in the spaces provided. If 
you are filing electronically using a tax practi-
tioner, you can use a Self-Select PIN or a Prac-
titioner PIN.
Self-Select PIN. The Self-Select PIN method 
allows you to create your own PIN. If you are 
married filing jointly, you and your spouse will 
each need to create a PIN and enter these PINs 
as your electronic signatures.
A PIN is any combination of five digits you 
choose except five zeros. If you use a PIN, 
there is nothing to sign and nothing to mail—not 
even your Forms W-2.
Your electronic return is considered a valid 
signed return only when it includes your PIN; 
last name; date of birth; IP PIN, if applicable; 
and AGI from your originally filed 2021 federal 
income tax return, if applicable. If you're filing 
jointly, your electronic return must also include 
your spouse's PIN; last name; date of birth; IP 
PIN, if applicable; and AGI, if applicable, in or-
der to be considered validly signed. Don't use 
AGI from an amended return (Form 1040-X) or 
a math error correction made by the IRS. AGI is 
the amount shown on your 2021 Form 1040 or 
Form 1040-SR, line 11. If you don't have your 
2021 income tax return, you can request a tran-
script by using our automated self-service tool. 
Go to IRS.gov/Transcript. (If you filed electroni-
cally last year, you, and your spouse if filing 
jointly, may use your prior year PIN to verify 
your identity instead of your prior year AGI. The 
prior year PIN is the five-digit PIN you used to 
electronically sign your 2021 return.) You will 
also be prompted to enter your date of birth.
You can’t use the Self-Select PIN 
method if you are a first-time filer under 
age 16 at the end of 2022.
Practitioner PIN. The Practitioner PIN method 
allows you to authorize your tax practitioner to 
enter or generate your PIN. Your electronic re-
turn is considered a validly signed return only 
when it includes your PIN; last name; date of 
birth; and IP PIN, if applicable. If you’re filing 
jointly, your electronic return must also include 
your spouse’s PIN; last name; date of birth; and 
IP PIN, if applicable, in order to be considered a 
validly signed return. The practitioner can pro-
vide you with details.
Form 8453. You must send in a paper Form 
8453 if you have to attach certain forms or other 
documents that can’t be electronically filed. For 
details, see Form 8453. For more details, visit 
IRS.gov/efile.
Identity Protection PIN. If the IRS gave you 
an identity protection personal identification 
number (IP PIN), enter it in the spaces provided 
on your tax form. If the IRS hasn’t given you this 
type of number, leave these spaces blank. For 
more information, see the Instructions for Form 
1040.
All taxpayers are now eligible for an IP 
PIN. For more information, see Pub. 
5477. To apply for an IP PIN, go to 
IRS.gov/IPPIN and use the Get an IP PIN tool.
Power of attorney. If an agent is signing your 
return for you, a power of attorney (POA) must 
be filed. Attach the POA to Form 8453 and file it 
using that form's instructions. See Signatures, 
later, for more information on POAs.
State returns. In most states, you can file an 
electronic state return simultaneously with your 
federal return. For more information, check with

fessional, or the IRS website at IRS.gov/efile.
Refunds. You can have a refund check mailed 
to you, or you can have your refund deposited 
directly to your checking or savings account or 
split among two or three accounts. With e-file, 
your refund will be issued faster than if you filed 
on paper.
As with a paper return, you may not get all of 
your refund if you owe certain past-due 
amounts, such as federal tax, state income tax, 
state unemployment compensation debts, child 
support, spousal support, or certain other fed-
eral nontax debts, such as student loans. See 
Offset against debts under Refunds, later.
Refund inquiries. Information about your re-
turn will generally be available within 24 hours 
after the IRS receives your e-filed return. See 
Refund Information, later.
Amount you owe. To avoid late-payment pen-
alties and interest, pay your taxes in full by April 
18, 2023 (for most people). See How To Pay, 
later, for information on how to pay the amount 
you owe.
Using Your Personal Computer
You can file your tax return in a fast, 
easy, and convenient way using your 
personal computer. A computer with In-
ternet access and tax preparation software are 
all you need. Best of all, you can e-file from the 
comfort of your home 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week.
IRS-approved tax preparation software is 
available for online use on the Internet, for 
download from the Internet, and in retail stores. 
For information, visit IRS.gov/efile.
Through Employers and Financial 
Institutions
Some businesses offer free e-file to their em-
ployees, members, or customers. Others offer it 
for a fee. Ask your employer or financial institu-
tion if they offer IRS e-file as an employee, 
member, or customer benefit.

Note. Tax professionals may charge a fee 
for IRS e-file. Fees can vary depending on the 
professional and the specific services rendered.
When Do I
Have To File?
April 18, 2023, is the due date for filing your 
2022 income tax return if you use the calendar 
year. The due date is April 18, instead of April 
15, because of the Emancipation Day holiday in 
the District of Columbia—even if you don't live 
in the District of Columbia. For a quick view of 
due dates for filing a return with or without an 
extension of time to file (discussed later), see 
Table 1-5.
If you use a fiscal year (a year ending on the 
last day of any month except December, or a 
52-53-week year), your income tax return is due 
by the 15th day of the 4th month after the close 
of your fiscal year.
When the due date for doing any act for tax 
purposes—filing 
a 
return, 
paying 
taxes, 
etc.—falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holi-
day, the due date is delayed until the next busi-
ness day.
Filing paper returns on time. Your paper re-
turn is filed on time if it is mailed in an envelope 
that is properly addressed, has enough post-
age, and is postmarked by the due date. If you 
send your return by registered mail, the date of 
the registration is the postmark date. The regis-
tration is evidence that the return was delivered. 
If you send a return by certified mail and have 
your receipt postmarked by a postal employee, 
the date on the receipt is the postmark date. 
The postmarked certified mail receipt is evi-
dence that the return was delivered.
Private delivery services. If you choose to 
mail your return, you can use certain private de-
livery services designated by the IRS to meet 
the “timely mailing treated as timely filing/
paying” rule for tax returns and payments. 
These private delivery services include only the 
following.
•
DHL Express 9:00, DHL Express 10:30, 
DHL Express 12:00, DHL Express World-
wide, DHL Express Envelope, DHL Import 
Express 10:30, DHL Import Express 12:00, 
and DHL Import Express Worldwide.
•
UPS Next Day Air Early A.M., UPS Next 
Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd 
Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air A.M., UPS 
Worldwide Express Plus, and UPS World-
wide Express.
•
FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority 
Overnight, FedEx Standard Overnight, Fe-
dEx 2 Day, FedEx International Next Flight 
Out, FedEx International Priority, FedEx In-
ternational First, and FedEx International 
Economy.
To check for any updates to the list of desig-
nated private delivery services, go to IRS.gov/
PDS. For the IRS mailing addresses to use if 
you’re using a private delivery service, go to 
IRS.gov/PDSStreetAddresses.
The private delivery service can tell you how 
to get written proof of the mailing date.
Filing electronic returns on time. If you use 
IRS e-file, your return is considered filed on 
time if the authorized electronic return transmit-
ter postmarks the transmission by the due date. 
An authorized electronic return transmitter is a 
participant in the IRS e-file program that trans-
mits electronic tax return information directly to 
the IRS.
The electronic postmark is a record of when 
the authorized electronic return transmitter re-
ceived the transmission of your electronically 
filed return on its host system. The date and 
time in your time zone controls whether your 
electronically filed return is timely.
Filing late. If you don't file your return by the 
due date, you may have to pay a failure-to-file 
penalty and interest. For more information, see 
Penalties, later. Also see Interest under Amount 
You Owe, later.
If you were due a refund but you didn't file a 
return, you must generally file within 3 years 
from the date the return was due (including ex-
tensions) to get that refund.
Nonresident alien. If you are a nonresident 
alien and earn wages subject to U.S. income 
tax withholding, your 2022 U.S. income tax re-
turn (Form 1040-NR) is due by:
•
April 18, 2023, if you use a calendar year; 
or
•
The 15th day of the 4th month after the 
end of your fiscal year, if you use a fiscal 
year.
If you don't earn wages subject to U.S. in-
come tax withholding, your return is due by:
•
June 15, 2023, if you use a calendar year; 
or
•
The 15th day of the 6th month after the 
end of your fiscal year, if you use a fiscal 
year.
See Pub. 519 for more filing information.
Filing for a decedent. If you must file a final 
income tax return for a taxpayer who died dur-
ing the year (a decedent), the return is due by 
the 15th day of the 4th month after the end of 
the decedent's normal tax year. See Pub. 559.
Extensions of Time To File
You may be able to get an extension of time to 
file your return. There are three types of situa-
tions where you may qualify for an extension.
•
Automatic extensions.
•
You are outside the United States.
•
You are serving in a combat zone.
Automatic Extension
If you can’t file your 2022 return by the due 
date, you may be able to get an automatic 
6-month extension of time to file.
Example. If your return is due on April 18, 
2023, you will have until October 16, 2023, to 
file.
If you don't pay the tax due by the regu-
lar due date (April 15 for most taxpay-
ers), you will owe interest. You may 
also be charged penalties, discussed later.
How to get the automatic extension. You 
can get the automatic extension by:
1. Using IRS e-file (electronic filing), or
2. Filing a paper form.
E-file options. There are two ways you can 
use e-file to get an extension of time to file. 
Complete Form 4868 to use as a worksheet. If 
you think you may owe tax when you file your 
return, use Part II of the form to estimate your 
balance due. If you e-file Form 4868 to the IRS, 
don't send a paper Form 4868.
E-file using your personal computer or a 
tax professional. You can use a tax software 
package with your personal computer or a tax 
professional to file Form 4868 electronically. 
Free File and Free File Fillable Forms, both 
available at IRS.gov, allow you to prepare and 
e-file Form 4868 for free. You will need to pro-
vide certain information from your 2021 tax re-
turn. If you wish to make a payment by direct 
transfer from your bank account, see Pay online 
under How To Pay, later, in this chapter.
E-file and pay by credit or debit card or 
by direct transfer from your bank account. 
You can get an extension by paying part or all of 
your estimate of tax due by using a credit or 
debit card or by direct transfer from your bank 
account. You can do this by phone or over the 
Internet. You don't file Form 4868. See Pay on-
line under How To Pay, later, in this chapter.
Filing a paper Form 4868. You can get an ex-
tension of time to file by filing a paper Form 
4868. If you are a fiscal year taxpayer, you must 
file a paper Form 4868. Mail it to the address 
shown in the form instructions.
If you want to make a payment with the 
form, make your check or money order payable 
to “United States Treasury.” Write your SSN, 
daytime phone number, and “2022 Form 4868” 
on your check or money order.
When to file. You must request the automatic 
extension by the due date for your return. You 
can file your return any time before the 6-month 
extension period ends.

When you file your return. Enter any pay-
ment you made related to the extension of time 
to file on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 10.
Individuals Outside the
United States
You are allowed an automatic 2-month exten-
sion, without filing Form 4868 (until June 15, 
2023, if you use the calendar year), to file your 
2022 return and pay any federal income tax due 
if:
1. You are a U.S. citizen or resident; and
2. On the due date of your return:
a. You are living outside the United 
States and Puerto Rico, and your 
main place of business or post of duty 
is outside the United States and Pu-
erto Rico; or
b. You are in military or naval service on 
duty outside the United States and
Puerto Rico.
However, if you pay the tax due after the 
regular due date (April 15 for most taxpayers), 
interest will be charged from that date until the 
date the tax is paid.
If you served in a combat zone or qualified 
hazardous duty area, you may be eligible for a 
longer extension of time to file. See Individuals 
Serving in Combat Zone, later, for special rules 
that apply to you.
Married taxpayers. If you file a joint return, 
only one spouse has to qualify for this auto-
matic extension. If you and your spouse file 
separate returns, the automatic extension ap-
plies only to the spouse who qualifies.
How to get the extension. To use this auto-
matic extension, you must attach a statement to 
your return explaining what situation qualified 
you for the extension. (See the situations listed 
under (2), earlier.)
Extensions beyond 2 months. If you can’t file 
your return within the automatic 2-month exten-
sion period, you may be able to get an addi-
tional 4-month extension, for a total of 6 
months. File Form 4868 and check the box on 
line 8.
No further extension. An extension of more 
than 6 months will generally not be granted. 
However, if you are outside the United States 
and meet certain tests, you may be granted a 
longer extension. For more information, see 
When To File and Pay in Pub. 54.
Individuals Serving in
Combat Zone
The deadline for filing your tax return, paying 
any tax you may owe, and filing a claim for re-
fund is automatically extended if you serve in a 
combat zone. This applies to members of the 
Armed Forces, as well as merchant marines 
serving aboard vessels under the operational 
control of the Department of Defense, Red 
Cross personnel, accredited correspondents, 
and civilians under the direction of the Armed 
Forces in support of the Armed Forces.
Combat zone. A combat zone is any area the 
President of the United States designates by 
executive order as an area in which the U.S. 
Armed Forces are engaging or have engaged in 
combat. An area usually becomes a combat 
zone and ceases to be a combat zone on the 
dates the President designates by executive or-
der. For purposes of the automatic extension, 
the term “combat zone” includes the following 
areas.
1. The Arabian peninsula area, effective Jan-
uary 17, 1991.
2. The Kosovo area, effective March 24, 
1999.
3. The Afghanistan area, effective Septem-
ber 19, 2001.
See Pub. 3 for more detailed information on 
the locations comprising each combat zone. 
Pub. 3 also has information about other tax ben-
efits available to military personnel serving in a 
combat zone.
Extension period. The deadline for filing your 
return, paying any tax due, filing a claim for re-
fund, and taking other actions with the IRS is 
extended in two steps. First, your deadline is 
extended for 180 days after the later of:
1. The last day you are in a combat zone or 
the last day the area qualifies as a combat 
zone, or
2. The last day of any continuous qualified 
hospitalization (defined later) for injury 
from service in the combat zone.
Second, in addition to the 180 days, your 
deadline is also extended by the number of 
days you had left to take action with the IRS 
when you entered the combat zone. For exam-
ple, you have 31/2 months (January 1–April 15) 
to file your tax return. Any days left in this period 
when you entered the combat zone (or the en-
tire 31/2 months if you entered it before the be-
ginning of the year) are added to the 180 days. 
See Extension of Deadlines in Pub. 3 for more 
information.
The rules on the extension for filing your re-
turn also apply when you are deployed outside 
the United States (away from your permanent 
duty station) while participating in a designated 
contingency operation.
Qualified hospitalization. The hospitalization 
must be the result of an injury received while 
serving in a combat zone or a contingency op-
eration. Qualified hospitalization means:
•
Any hospitalization outside the United 
States, and
•
Up to 5 years of hospitalization in the Uni-
ted States.
See Pub. 3 for more information on qualified 
hospitalizations.
How Do I Prepare
My Return?
This section explains how to get ready to fill in 
your tax return and when to report your income 
and expenses. It also explains how to complete 
certain sections of the form. You may find Ta-
ble 1-6 helpful when you prepare your paper re-
turn.
Six Steps for Preparing 
Your Paper Return
1 — Get your records together for income 
and expenses.
2 — Get the forms, schedules, and 
publications you need.
3 — Fill in your return.
4 — Check your return to make sure it is 
correct.
5 — Sign and date your return.
6 — Attach all required forms and 
schedules.
Electronic returns. For information you may 
find useful in preparing an electronic return, see 
Why Should I File Electronically, earlier.
Substitute tax forms. You can’t use your own 
version of a tax form unless it meets the re-
quirements explained in Pub. 1167.
Form W-2. If you were an employee, you 
should receive Form W-2 from your employer. 
You will need the information from this form to 
prepare your return. See Form W-2 under 
Credit for Withholding and Estimated Tax for 
2022 in chapter 4.
Your employer is required to provide or send 
Form W-2 to you no later than January 31, 
2023. If it is mailed, you should allow adequate 
time to receive it before contacting your em-
ployer. If you still don't get the form by early 
February, the IRS can help you by requesting 
the form from your employer. When you request 
IRS help, be prepared to provide the following 
information.
•
Your name, address (including ZIP code), 
and phone number.
•
Your SSN.
•
Your dates of employment.
•
Your employer's name, address (including 
ZIP code), and phone number.
Form 1099. If you received certain types of in-
come, you may receive a Form 1099. For exam-
ple, if you received taxable interest of $10 or 
more, the payer is required to provide or send 
Form 1099 to you no later than January 31, 
2023 (or by February 15, 2023, if furnished by a 
broker). If it is mailed, you should allow ade-
quate time to receive it before contacting the 
payer. If you still don't get the form by February 
15 (or by March 1, 2023, if furnished by a 
broker), call the IRS for help.
When Do I Report My
Income and Expenses?
You must figure your taxable income on the ba-
sis of a tax year. A “tax year” is an annual ac-
counting period used for keeping records and 
reporting income and expenses. You must ac-
count for your income and expenses in a way 
that clearly shows your taxable income. The 
way you do this is called an accounting method. 
Table 1-6.
Chapter 1 Filing Information Page 11

This section explains which accounting periods 
and methods you can use.
Accounting Periods
Most individual tax returns cover a calendar 
year—the 12 months from January 1 through 
December 31. If you don't use a calendar year, 
your accounting period is a fiscal year. A regu-
lar fiscal year is a 12-month period that ends on 
the last day of any month except December. A 
52-53-week fiscal year varies from 52 to 53 
weeks and always ends on the same day of the 
week.
You choose your accounting period (tax 
year) when you file your first income tax return. 
It can’t be longer than 12 months.
More information. For more information on 
accounting periods, including how to change 
your accounting period, see Pub. 538.
Accounting Methods
Your accounting method is the way you account 
for your income and expenses. Most taxpayers 
use either the cash method or an accrual 
method. You choose a method when you file 
your first income tax return. If you want to 
change your accounting method after that, you 
must generally get IRS approval. Use Form 
3115 to request an accounting method change.
Cash method. If you use this method, report 
all items of income in the year in which you ac-
tually or constructively receive them. Generally, 
you deduct all expenses in the year you actually 
pay them. This is the method most individual 
taxpayers use.
Constructive receipt. Generally, you con-
structively receive income when it is credited to 
your account or set apart in any way that makes 
it available to you. You don't need to have phys-
ical possession of it. For example, interest 
credited to your bank account on December 31, 
2022, is taxable income to you in 2022 if you 
could have withdrawn it in 2022 (even if the 
amount isn't entered in your records or with-
drawn until 2023).
Garnished wages. If your employer uses 
your wages to pay your debts, or if your wages 
are attached or garnished, the full amount is 
constructively received by you. You must in-
clude these wages in income for the year you 
would have received them.
Debts paid for you. If another person can-
cels or pays your debts (but not as a gift or 
loan), you have constructively received the 
amount and must generally include it in your 
gross income for the year. See Canceled Debts 
in chapter 8 for more information.
Payment to third party. If a third party is 
paid income from property you own, you have 
constructively received the income. It is the 
same as if you had actually received the income 
and paid it to the third party.
Payment to an agent. Income an agent re-
ceives for you is income you constructively re-
ceived in the year the agent receives it. If you 
indicate in a contract that your income is to be 
paid to another person, you must include the 
amount in your gross income when the other 
person receives it.
Check received or available. A valid check 
that was made available to you before the end 
of the tax year is constructively received by you 
in that year. A check that was “made available 
to you” includes a check you have already re-
ceived, but not cashed or deposited. It also in-
cludes, for example, your last paycheck of the 
year that your employer made available for you 
to pick up at the office before the end of the 
year. It is constructively received by you in that 
year whether or not you pick it up before the 
end of the year or wait to receive it by mail after 
the end of the year.
No constructive receipt. There may be 
facts to show that you didn't constructively re-
ceive income.
Example. Taxpayer Z, a teacher, agreed to 
the school board's condition that, in Z’s ab-
sence, Z would receive only the difference be-
tween Z’s regular salary and the salary of a sub-
stitute teacher hired by the school board. 
Therefore, Z didn't constructively receive the 
amount by which Z’s salary was reduced to pay 
the substitute teacher.
Accrual method. If you use an accrual 
method, you generally report income when you 
earn it, rather than when you receive it. You 
generally deduct your expenses when you incur 
them, rather than when you pay them.
Income paid in advance. An advance pay-
ment of income is generally included in gross 
income in the year you receive it. Your method 
of accounting doesn't matter as long as the in-
come is available to you. An advance payment 
may include rent or interest you receive in ad-
vance and pay for services you will perform 
later.
A limited deferral until the next tax year may 
be allowed for certain advance payments. See 
Pub. 538 for specific information.
Additional information. For more information 
on accounting methods, including how to 
change your accounting method, see Pub. 538.
Social Security Number 
(SSN)
You must enter your SSN on your return. If you 
are married, enter the SSNs for both you and 
your spouse, whether you file jointly or sepa-
rately.
If you are filing a joint return, include the 
SSNs in the same order as the names. Use this 
same order in submitting other forms and docu-
ments to the IRS.
If you, or your spouse if filing jointly, 
don't have an SSN (or ITIN) issued on 
or before the due date of your 2022 re-
turn (including extensions), you can't claim cer-
tain tax benefits on your original or an amended 
2022 return.
Once you are issued an SSN, use it to file 
your tax return. Use your SSN to file your tax re-
turn even if your SSN does not authorize em-
ployment or if you have been issued an SSN 
that authorizes employment and you lose your 
employment authorization. An ITIN will not be 
issued to you once you have been issued an 
SSN. If you received your SSN after previously 
CAUTION
!
using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. Use your 
SSN instead.
Check that both the name and SSN on your 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR, W-2, and 1099 agree 
with your social security card. If they don't, cer-
tain deductions and credits on your Form 1040 
or 1040-SR may be reduced or disallowed and 
you may not receive credit for your social secur-
ity earnings. If your Form W-2 shows an incor-
rect SSN or name, notify your employer or the 
form-issuing agent as soon as possible to make 
sure your earnings are credited to your social 
security record. If the name or SSN on your so-
cial security card is incorrect, call the Social Se-
curity Administration (SSA) at 800-772-1213.
Name change. If you changed your name be-
cause of marriage, divorce, etc., be sure to re-
port the change to your local SSA office before 
filing your return. This prevents delays in pro-
cessing your return and issuing refunds. It also 
safeguards your future social security benefits.
Dependent's SSN. You must provide the SSN 
of each dependent you claim, regardless of the 
dependent's age. This requirement applies to 
all dependents (not just your children) claimed 
on your tax return.
Your child must have an SSN valid for 
employment issued before the due 
date of your 2022 return (including ex-
tensions) to be considered a qualifying child for 
certain tax benefits on your original or amended 
2022 return. See chapter 14.
Exception. If your child was born and died 
in 2022 and didn't have an SSN, enter “DIED” in 
column (2) of the Dependents section of Form 
1040 or 1040-SR and include a copy of the 
child's birth certificate, death certificate, or hos-
pital records. The document must show that the 
child was born alive.
No SSN. File Form SS-5, Application for a So-
cial Security Card, with your local SSA office to 
get an SSN for yourself or your dependent. It 
usually takes about 2 weeks to get an SSN. If 
you or your dependent isn't eligible for an SSN, 
see Individual taxpayer identification number 
(ITIN), later.
If you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien, you 
must show proof of age, identity, and citizen-
ship or alien status with your Form SS-5. If you 
are 12 or older and have never been assigned 
an SSN, you must appear in person with this 
proof at an SSA office.
Form SS-5 is available at any SSA office, on 
the Internet at SSA.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf, or by 
calling 800-772-1213. If you have any questions 
about which documents you can use as proof of 
age, identity, or citizenship, contact your SSA 
office.
If your dependent doesn't have an SSN by 
the time your return is due, you may want to ask 
for an extension of time to file, as explained ear-
lier under When Do I Have To File.
If you don't provide a required SSN or if you 
provide an incorrect SSN, your tax may be in-
creased and any refund may be reduced.
Adoption taxpayer identification number 
(ATIN). If you are in the process of adopting a 
child who is a U.S. citizen or resident and can’t 
CAUTION
!
Page 12 Chapter 1 Filing Information

get an SSN for the child until the adoption is fi-
nal, you can apply for an ATIN to use instead of 
an SSN.
File Form W-7A, Application for Taxpayer 
Identification Number for Pending U.S. Adop-
tions, with the IRS to get an ATIN if all of the fol-
lowing are true.
•
You have a child living with you who was 
placed in your home for legal adoption.
•
You can’t get the child's existing SSN even 
though you have made a reasonable at-
tempt to get it from the birth parents, the 
placement agency, and other persons.
•
You can’t get an SSN for the child from the 
SSA because, for example, the adoption 
isn't final.
•
You are eligible to claim the child as a de-
pendent on your tax return.
After the adoption is final, you must apply for an 
SSN for the child. You can’t continue using the 
ATIN.
See Form W-7A for more information.
Nonresident alien spouse. If your spouse is a 
nonresident alien, your spouse must have either 
an SSN or an ITIN if:
•
You file a joint return, or
•
Your spouse is filing a separate return.
If your spouse isn't eligible for an SSN, see the 
following discussion on ITINs.
Individual taxpayer identification number 
(ITIN). The IRS will issue you an ITIN if you are 
a nonresident or resident alien and you don't 
have and aren’t eligible to get an SSN. This also 
applies to an alien spouse or dependent. To ap-
ply for an ITIN, file Form W-7 with the IRS. It 
usually takes about 7 weeks to get an ITIN. En-
ter the ITIN on your tax return wherever an SSN 
is requested.
Make sure your ITIN hasn’t expired. See In-
dividual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) 
renewal, earlier, for more information on expira-
tion and renewal of ITINs. You can also find 
more information at IRS.gov/ITIN.
If you are applying for an ITIN for your-
self, your spouse, or a dependent in or-
der to file your tax return, attach your 
completed tax return to your Form W-7. See the 
Form W-7 instructions for how and where to file.
You can’t e-file a return using an ITIN in 
the calendar year the ITIN is issued; 
however, you can e-file returns in the 
following years.
ITIN for tax use only. An ITIN is for federal 
tax use only. It doesn't entitle you to social se-
curity benefits or change your employment or 
immigration status under U.S. law.
Penalty for not providing social security 
number. If you don't include your SSN or the 
SSN of your spouse or dependent as required, 
you may have to pay a penalty. See the discus-
sion on Penalties, later, for more information.
SSN on correspondence. If you write to the 
IRS about your tax account, be sure to include 
your SSN (and the name and SSN of your 
spouse, if you filed a joint return) in your corre-
spondence. Because your SSN is used to iden-
TIP
CAUTION
!
tify your account, this helps the IRS respond to 
your correspondence promptly.
Presidential Election
Campaign Fund
This fund helps pay for Presidential election 
campaigns. The fund also helps pay for pedia-
tric medical research. If you want $3 to go to 
this fund, check the box. If you are filing a joint 
return, your spouse can also have $3 go to the 
fund. If you check the box, your tax or refund 
won't change.
Computations
The following information may be useful in mak-
ing the return easier to complete.
Rounding off dollars. You can round off cents 
to whole dollars on your return and schedules. If 
you do round to whole dollars, you must round 
all amounts. To round, drop amounts under 50 
cents and increase amounts from 50 to 99 
cents to the next dollar. For example, $1.39 be-
comes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3.
If you have to add two or more amounts to 
figure the amount to enter on a line, include 
cents when adding the amounts and round off 
only the total.
If you are entering amounts that include 
cents, make sure to include the decimal point. 
There is no cents column on Form 1040 or 
1040-SR.
Equal amounts. If you are asked to enter the 
smaller or larger of two equal amounts, enter 
that amount.
Negative amounts. If you file a paper return 
and you need to enter a negative amount, put 
the amount in parentheses rather than using a 
minus sign. To combine positive and negative 
amounts, add all the positive amounts together 
and then subtract the negative amounts.
Attachments
Depending on the form you file and the items 
reported on your return, you may have to com-
plete additional schedules and forms and attach 
them to your paper return.
You may be able to file a paperless re-
turn using IRS e-file. There's nothing to 
attach or mail, not even your Forms 
W-2. See Why Should I File Electronically, ear-
lier.
Form W-2. Form W-2 is a statement from your 
employer of wages and other compensation 
paid to you and taxes withheld from your pay. 
You should have a Form W-2 from each em-
ployer. If you file a paper return, be sure to at-
tach a copy of Form W-2 in the place indicated 
on your return. For more information, see Form 
W-2 in chapter 4.
Form 1099-R. If you received a Form 1099-R 
showing federal income tax withheld, and you 
file a paper return, attach a copy of that form in 
the place indicated on your return.
TIP
Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If you file a paper re-
turn, attach any forms and schedules behind 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR in order of the “Attach-
ment Sequence No.” shown in the upper right 
corner of the form or schedule. Then, arrange 
all other statements or attachments in the same 
order as the forms and schedules they relate to 
and attach them last. Don't attach items unless 
required to do so.
Third Party Designee
If you want to allow your preparer, a friend, a 
family member, or any other person you choose 
to discuss your 2022 tax return with the IRS, 
check the “Yes” box in the “Third Party Desig-
nee” area of your return. Also, enter the design-
ee's name, phone number, and any five digits 
the designee chooses as his or her personal 
identification number (PIN).
If you check the “Yes” box, you, and your 
spouse if filing a joint return, are authorizing the 
IRS to call the designee to answer any ques-
tions that arise during the processing of your re-
turn. You are also authorizing the designee to:
•
Give information that is missing from your 
return to the IRS;
•
Call the IRS for information about the pro-
cessing of your return or the status of your 
refund or payments;
•
Receive copies of notices or transcripts re-
lated to your return, upon request; and
•
Respond to certain IRS notices about math 
errors, offsets (see Refunds, later), and re-
turn preparation.
You aren't authorizing the designee to re-
ceive any refund check, bind you to anything 
(including any additional tax liability), or other-
wise represent you before the IRS. If you want 
to expand the designee's authorization, see 
Pub. 947.
The authorization will automatically end no 
later than the due date (without any extensions) 
for filing your 2023 tax return. This is April 15, 
2024, for most people.
See your form instructions for more informa-
tion.
Signatures
You must sign and date your return. If you file a 
joint return, both you and your spouse must 
sign the return, even if only one of you had in-
come.
If you file a joint return, both spouses 
are generally liable for the tax, and the 
entire tax liability may be assessed 
against either spouse. See chapter 2.
Your return isn't considered a valid return 
unless you sign it in accordance with the re-
quirements in the instructions for your return.
You must handwrite your signature on your 
return if you file it on paper. Digital, electronic, 
or typed-font signatures are not valid signatures 
for Forms 1040 or 1040-SR filed on paper.
If you electronically file your return, you can 
use an electronic signature to sign your return in 
accordance with the requirements contained in 
the instructions for your return.
CAUTION
!
Chapter 1 Filing Information Page 13

Failure to sign your return in accordance 
with these requirements may prevent you from 
obtaining a refund.
Enter your occupation. If you file a joint re-
turn, enter both your occupation and your spou-
se's occupation.
When someone can sign for you. You can 
appoint an agent to sign your return if you are:
1. Unable to sign the return because of dis-
ease or injury,
2. Absent from the United States for a contin-
uous period of at least 60 days before the 
due date for filing your return, or
3. Given permission to do so by the IRS of-
fice in your area.
Power of attorney. A return signed by an 
agent in any of these cases must have a power 
of attorney (POA) attached that authorizes the 
agent to sign for you. You can use a POA that 
states that the agent is granted authority to sign 
the return, or you can use Form 2848. Part I of 
Form 2848 must state that the agent is granted 
authority to sign the return.
Court-appointed conservator, guardian, or 
other fiduciary. If you are a court-appointed 
conservator, guardian, or other fiduciary for a 
mentally or physically incompetent individual 
who has to file a tax return, sign your name for 
the individual. File Form 56.
Unable to sign. If the taxpayer is mentally 
competent but physically unable to sign the re-
turn or POA, a valid “signature” is defined under 
state law. It can be anything that clearly indi-
cates the taxpayer's intent to sign. For example, 
the taxpayer's “X” with the signatures of two wit-
nesses might be considered a valid signature 
under a state's law.
Spouse unable to sign. If your spouse is un-
able to sign for any reason, see Signing a joint 
return in chapter 2.
Child's return. If a child has to file a tax return 
but can’t sign the return, the child's parent, 
guardian, or another legally responsible person 
must sign the child's name, followed by the 
words “By (your signature), parent for minor 
child.”
Paid Preparer
Generally, anyone you pay to prepare, assist in 
preparing, or review your tax return must sign it 
and fill in the other blanks, including their Pre-
parer Tax Identification Number (PTIN), in the 
paid preparer's area of your return.
Many preparers are required to e-file the tax 
returns they prepare. They sign these e-filed re-
turns using their tax preparation software. How-
ever, you can choose to have your return com-
pleted on paper if you prefer. In that case, the 
paid preparer can sign the paper return man-
ually or use a rubber stamp or mechanical de-
vice. The preparer is personally responsible for 
affixing their signature to the return.
If the preparer is self-employed (that is, not 
employed by any person or business to prepare 
the return), the preparer should check the 
self-employed box in the “Paid Preparer Use 
Only” space on the return.
The preparer must give you a copy of your 
return in addition to the copy filed with the IRS.
If you prepare your own return, leave this 
area blank. If another person prepares your re-
turn and doesn't charge you, that person 
shouldn't sign your return.
If you have questions about whether a pre-
parer must sign your return, contact any IRS of-
fice.
Refunds
When you complete your return, you will deter-
mine if you paid more income tax than you 
owed. If so, you can get a refund of the amount 
you overpaid or you can choose to apply all or 
part of the overpayment to your next year's 
(2023) estimated tax.
If you choose to have a 2022 overpay-
ment applied to your 2023 estimated 
tax, you can’t change your mind and 
have any of it refunded to you after the due date 
(without extensions) of your 2022 return.
Follow the Instructions for Form 1040 to 
complete the entries to claim your refund and/or 
to apply your overpayment to your 2023 estima-
ted tax.
If your refund for 2022 is large, you 
may want to decrease the amount of 
income tax withheld from your pay in 
2023. See chapter 4 for more information.
Instead of getting a pa-
per check, you may be 
able to have your refund deposited directly into 
your checking or savings account, including an 
individual retirement arrangement (IRA). Follow 
the Instructions for Form 1040 to request direct 
deposit. If the direct deposit can’t be done, the 
IRS will send a check instead.
Don't request a deposit of any part of your 
refund to an account that isn't in your name. 
Don't allow your tax preparer to deposit any part 
of your refund into the preparer’s account. The 
number of direct deposits to a single account or 
prepaid debit card is limited to three refunds a 
year. After this limit is exceeded, paper checks 
will be sent instead. Learn more at IRS.gov/
Individuals/Direct-Deposit-Limits.
IRA.  You can have your refund (or part of it) di-
rectly deposited to a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, 
or SEP-IRA, but not a SIMPLE IRA. You must 
establish the IRA at a bank or financial institu-
tion before you request direct deposit.
TreasuryDirect®. You can request a deposit 
of your refund to a TreasuryDirect® online ac-
count to buy U.S. Treasury marketable securi-
ties (if available) and savings bonds. For more 
information, go to https://TreasuryDirect.gov.
Split refunds. If you choose direct deposit, 
you may be able to split the refund and have it 
deposited among two or three accounts or buy 
up to $5,000 in paper or electronic series I sav-
ings bonds. Complete Form 8888 and attach it 
to your return.
Overpayment less than one dollar. If your 
overpayment is less than one dollar, you won't 
get a refund unless you ask for it in writing.
CAUTION
!
TIP
Simple. Safe. Secure.
DIRECT DEPOSIT
Cashing your refund check. Cash your tax 
refund check soon after you receive it. Checks 
expire the last business day of the 12th month 
of issue.
If your check has expired, you can apply to 
the IRS to have it reissued.
Refund more or less than expected. If you 
receive a check for a refund you aren’t entitled 
to, or for an overpayment that should have been 
credited to estimated tax, don't cash the check. 
Call the IRS.
If you receive a check for more than the re-
fund you claimed, don't cash the check until you 
receive a notice explaining the difference.
If your refund check is for less than you 
claimed, it should be accompanied by a notice 
explaining the difference. Cashing the check 
doesn't stop you from claiming an additional 
amount of refund.
If you didn't receive a notice and you have 
any questions about the amount of your refund, 
you should wait 2 weeks. If you still haven’t re-
ceived a notice, call the IRS.
Offset against debts. If you are due a refund 
but haven’t paid certain amounts you owe, all or 
part of your refund may be used to pay all or 
part of the past-due amount. This includes 
past-due federal income tax, other federal 
debts (such as student loans), state income tax, 
child and spousal support payments, and state 
unemployment compensation debt. You will be 
notified if the refund you claimed has been off-
set against your debts.
Joint return and injured spouse. When a 
joint return is filed and only one spouse owes a 
past-due amount, the other spouse can be con-
sidered an injured spouse. An injured spouse 
should file Form 8379, Injured Spouse Alloca-
tion, if both of the following apply and the 
spouse wants a refund of their share of the 
overpayment shown on the joint return.
1. You aren’t legally obligated to pay the 
past-due amount.
2. You made and reported tax payments 
(such as federal income tax withheld from 
your wages or estimated tax payments), or 
claimed a refundable tax credit (see the 
credits listed under Who Should File, ear-
lier).
Note. If the injured spouse's residence was 
in a community property state at any time dur-
ing the tax year, special rules may apply. See 
the Instructions for Form 8379.
If you haven’t filed your joint return and you 
know that your joint refund will be offset, file 
Form 8379 with your return. You should receive 
your refund within 14 weeks from the date the 
paper return is filed or within 11 weeks from the 
date the return is filed electronically.
If you filed your joint return and your joint re-
fund was offset, file Form 8379 by itself. When 
filed after offset, it can take up to 8 weeks to re-
ceive your refund. Don't attach the previously 
filed tax return, but do include copies of all 
Forms W-2 and W-2G for both spouses and 
any Forms 1099 that show income tax withheld. 
The processing of Form 8379 may be delayed if 
these forms aren’t attached, or if the form is in-
complete when filed.
Page 14 Chapter 1 Filing Information

A separate Form 8379 must be filed for each 
tax year to be considered.
An injured spouse claim is different 
from an innocent spouse relief request. 
An injured spouse uses Form 8379 to 
request the division of the tax overpayment at-
tributed to each spouse. An innocent spouse 
uses Form 8857, Request for Innocent Spouse 
Relief, to request relief from joint liability for tax, 
interest, and penalties on a joint return for items 
of the other spouse (or former spouse) that 
were incorrectly reported on the joint return. For 
information on innocent spouses, see Relief 
from joint responsibility under Filing a Joint Re-
turn in chapter 2.
Amount You Owe
When you complete your return, you will deter-
mine if you have paid the full amount of tax that 
you owe. If you owe additional tax, you should 
pay it with your return.
You don't have to pay if the amount 
you owe is under $1.
If the IRS figures your tax for you, you will re-
ceive a bill for any tax that is due. You should 
pay this bill within 30 days (or by the due date of 
your return, if later). See Tax Figured by IRS in 
chapter 13.
If you don't pay your tax when due, you 
may have to pay a failure-to-pay pen-
alty. See Penalties, later. For more in-
formation about your balance due, see Pub. 
594.
If the amount you owe for 2022 is large, 
you may want to increase the amount 
of income tax withheld from your pay or 
make estimated tax payments for 2023. See 
chapter 4 for more information.
How To Pay
You can pay online, by phone, by mobile de-
vice, in cash, or by check or money order. Don't 
include any estimated tax payment for 2023 in 
this payment. Instead, make the estimated tax 
payment separately.
Bad check or payment. The penalty for writ-
ing a bad check to the IRS is $25 or 2% of the 
check, whichever is more. This penalty also ap-
plies to other forms of payment if the IRS 
doesn't receive the funds.
Pay online. Paying online is convenient and 
secure and helps make sure we get your pay-
ments on time.
You can pay online with a direct transfer 
from your bank account using IRS Direct Pay or 
the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System 
(EFTPS), or by debit or credit card.
To pay your taxes online or for more infor-
mation, go to IRS.gov/Payments.

as a check transaction. When we use informa-
tion from your check to make an electronic fund 
transfer, funds may be withdrawn from your ac-
count as soon as the same day we receive your 
payment, and you will not receive your check 
back from your financial institution.
No checks of $100 million or more accep-
ted. The IRS can’t accept a single check (in-
cluding a cashier’s check) for amounts of 
$100,000,000 ($100 million) or more. If you are 
sending $100 million or more by check, you’ll 
need to spread the payment over two or more 
checks with each check made out for an 
amount less than $100 million. This limit doesn’t 
apply to other methods of payment (such as 
electronic 
payments). 
Please 
consider 
a 
method of payment other than check if the 
amount of the payment is over $100 million.
Estimated tax payments. Don't include any 
2023 estimated tax payment in the payment for 
your 2022 income tax return. See chapter 4 for 
information on how to pay estimated tax.
Interest
Interest is charged on tax you don't pay by the 
due date of your return. Interest is charged even 
if you get an extension of time for filing.
If the IRS figures your tax for you, to 
avoid interest for late payment, you 
must pay the bill by the date specified 
on the bill or by the due date of your return, 
whichever is later. For information, see Tax Fig-
ured by IRS in chapter 13.
Interest on penalties. Interest is charged on 
the failure-to-file penalty, the accuracy-related 
penalty, and the fraud penalty from the due date 
of the return (including extensions) to the date 
of payment. Interest on other penalties starts on 
the date of notice and demand, but isn't 
charged on penalties paid within 21 calendar 
days from the date of the notice (or within 10 
business days if the notice is for $100,000 or 
more).
Interest due to IRS error or delay. All or part 
of any interest you were charged can be for-
given if the interest is due to an unreasonable 
error or delay by an officer or employee of the 
IRS in performing a ministerial or managerial 
act.
A ministerial act is a procedural or mechani-
cal act that occurs during the processing of your 
case. A managerial act includes personnel 
transfers and extended personnel training. A 
decision concerning the proper application of 
federal tax law isn't a ministerial or managerial 
act.
The interest can be forgiven only if you 
aren’t responsible in any important way for the 
error or delay and the IRS has notified you in 
writing of the deficiency or payment. For more 
information, see Pub. 556.
Interest and certain penalties may also be 
suspended for a limited period if you filed your 
return by the due date (including extensions) 
and the IRS doesn't provide you with a notice 
specifically stating your liability and the basis for 
it before the close of the 36-month period be-
ginning on the later of:
•
The date the return is filed, or
•
The due date of the return without regard 
to extensions.
For more information, see Pub. 556.
Installment Agreement
If you can’t pay the full amount due with your re-
turn, you can ask to make monthly installment 
payments for the full or a partial amount. How-
ever, you will be charged interest and may be 
charged a late payment penalty on the tax not 
paid by the date your return is due, even if your 
request to pay in installments is granted. If your 
request is granted, you must also pay a fee. To 
limit the interest and penalty charges, pay as 
much of the tax as possible with your return. But 
before requesting an installment agreement, 
you should consider other less costly alterna-
tives, such as a bank loan or credit card pay-
ment. 
TIP
Chapter 1 Filing Information Page 15

To apply for an installment agreement on-
line, go to IRS.gov/OPA. You can also use 
Form 9465.
In addition to paying by check or money or-
der, you can use a credit or debit card or direct 
payment from your bank account to make in-
stallment agreement payments. See How To 
Pay, earlier.
Gift To Reduce Debt
Held by the Public
You can make a contribution (gift) to 
reduce debt held by the public. If you 
wish to do so, make a separate check 
payable to “Bureau of the Fiscal Service.”
Send your check to:
Bureau of the Fiscal Service
ATTN: Department G
P.O. Box 2188
Parkersburg, WV 26106-2188
Or enclose your separate check in the envelope 
with your income tax return. Don't add this gift 
to any tax you owe. 
For information on making this type of gift 
online, go to TreasururyDirect.gov/Help-Center/
Public-Debt-FAQs/#DebtFinance and see the 
information under “How do you make a contri-
bution to reduce the debt?”
You may be able to deduct this gift as a 
charitable contribution on next year's tax return 
if you itemize your deductions on Schedule A 
(Form 1040).
Name and Address
After you have completed your return, fill in your 
name and address in the appropriate area of 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
You must include your SSN in the cor-
rect place on your tax return.
P.O. box. If your post office doesn't deliver 
mail to your street address and you have a P.O. 
box, enter your P.O. box number on the line for 
your present home address instead of your 
street address.
Foreign address. If your address is outside 
the United States or its possessions or territo-
ries, enter the city name on the appropriate line 
of your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Don't enter any 
other information on that line, but also complete 
the spaces below that line.
1. Foreign country name.
2. Foreign province/state/county.
3. Foreign postal code.
Don’t abbreviate the country name. Follow the 
country's practice for entering the postal code 
and the name of the province, county, or state.
Where Do I File?
After you complete your return, you must send it 
to the IRS. You can mail it or you may be able to 
CAUTION
!
file it electronically. See Why Should I File Elec-
tronically, earlier.
Mailing your paper return. Mail your paper 
return to the address shown in the Instructions 
for Form 1040.
What Happens After
I File?
After you send your return to the IRS, you may 
have some questions. This section discusses 
concerns you may have about recordkeeping, 
your refund, and what to do if you move.
What Records Should
I Keep?
This part discusses why you should keep re-
cords, what kinds of records you should keep, 
and how long you should keep them.
You must keep records so that you can 
prepare a complete and accurate in-
come tax return. The law doesn't re-
quire any special form of records. However, you 
should keep all receipts, canceled checks or 
other proof of payment, and any other records 
to support any deductions or credits you claim.
If you file a claim for refund, you must be 
able to prove by your records that you have 
overpaid your tax.
This part doesn't discuss the records you 
should keep when operating a business. For in-
formation on business records, see Pub. 583.
Why Keep Records?
Good records help you:
•
Identify sources of income. Your re-
cords can identify the sources of your in-
come to help you separate business from 
nonbusiness income and taxable from 
nontaxable income.
•
Keep track of expenses. You can use 
your records to identify expenses for which 
you can claim a deduction. This helps you 
determine if you can itemize deductions on 
your tax return.
•
Keep track of the basis of property. 
You need to keep records that show the 
basis of your property. This includes the 
original cost or other basis of the property 
and any improvements you made.
•
Prepare tax returns. You need records to 
prepare your tax return.
•
Support items reported on tax returns. 
The IRS may question an item on your re-
turn. Your records will help you explain any 
item and arrive at the correct tax. If you 
can’t produce the correct documents, you 
may have to pay additional tax and be sub-
ject to penalties.
Kinds of Records To Keep
The IRS doesn't require you to keep your re-
cords in a particular way. Keep them in a man-
ner that allows you and the IRS to determine 
your correct tax.
RECORDS
You can use your checkbook to keep a re-
cord of your income and expenses. You also 
need to keep documents, such as receipts and 
sales slips, that can help prove a deduction.
In this section, you will find guidance about 
basic records that everyone should keep. The 
section also provides guidance about specific 
records you should keep for certain items.
Electronic records. All requirements that ap-
ply to hard copy books and records also apply 
to electronic storage systems that maintain tax 
books and records. When you replace hard 
copy books and records, you must maintain the 
electronic storage systems for as long as they 
are material to the administration of tax law.
For details on electronic storage system re-
quirements, see Revenue Procedure 97-22, 
which is on page 9 of Internal Revenue Bulletin 
1997-13 at IRS.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb97-13.pdf.
Copies of tax returns. You should keep cop-
ies of your tax returns as part of your tax re-
cords. They can help you prepare future tax re-
turns, and you will need them if you file an 
amended return or are audited. Copies of your 
returns and other records can be helpful to your 
survivor or the executor or administrator of your 
estate.
If necessary, you can request a copy of a re-
turn and all attachments (including Form W-2) 
from the IRS by using Form 4506. There is a 
charge for a copy of a return. For information on 
the cost and where to file, see the Instructions 
for Form 4506.
If you just need information from your return, 
you can order a transcript in one of the following 
ways.
•
Go to IRS.gov/Transcript.
•
Call 800-908-9946.
•
Use Form 4506-T or Form 4506T-EZ.
There is no fee for a transcript. For more infor-
mation, see Form 4506-T.
Basic Records
Basic records are documents that everybody 
should keep. These are the records that prove 
your income and expenses. If you own a home 
or investments, your basic records should con-
tain documents related to those items.
Income. Your 
basic 
records 
prove 
the 
amounts you report as income on your tax re-
turn. Your income may include wages, divi-
dends, interest, and partnership or S corpora-
tion distributions. Your records can also prove 
that certain amounts aren’t taxable, such as 
tax-exempt interest.
Note. If you receive a Form W-2, keep 
Copy C until you begin receiving social security 
benefits. This will help protect your benefits in 
case there is a question about your work record 
or earnings in a particular year.
Expenses. Your basic records prove the ex-
penses for which you claim a deduction (or 
credit) on your tax return. Your deductions may 
include alimony, charitable contributions, mort-
gage interest, and real estate taxes. You may 
also have childcare expenses for which you can 
claim a credit.
Page 16 Chapter 1 Filing Information

Home. Your basic records should enable you 
to determine the basis or adjusted basis of your 
home. You need this information to determine if 
you have a gain or loss when you sell your 
home or to figure depreciation if you use part of 
your home for business purposes or for rent. 
Your records should show the purchase price, 
settlement or closing costs, and the cost of any 
improvements. They may also show any casu-
alty losses deducted and insurance reimburse-
ments for casualty losses.
For detailed information on basis, including 
which settlement or closing costs are included 
in the basis of your home, see Pub. 551.
When you sell your home, your records 
should show the sales price and any selling ex-
penses, such as commissions. For information 
on selling your home, see Pub. 523.
Investments. Your basic records should ena-
ble you to determine your basis in an invest-
ment and whether you have a gain or loss when 
you sell it. Investments include stocks, bonds, 
and mutual funds. Your records should show 
the purchase price, sales price, and commis-
sions. They may also show any reinvested divi-
dends, 
stock 
splits 
and 
dividends, 
load 
charges, and original issue discount (OID).
For information on stocks, bonds, and mu-
tual funds, see Pub. 550 and Pub. 551.
Proof of Payment
One of your basic records is proof of payment. 
You should keep these records to support cer-
tain amounts shown on your tax return. Proof of 
payment alone isn't proof that the item claimed 
on your return is allowable. You should also 
keep other documents that will help prove that 
the item is allowable.
Generally, you prove payment with a cash 
receipt, financial account statement, credit card 
statement, canceled check, or substitute check. 
If you make payments in cash, you should get a 
dated and signed receipt showing the amount 
and the reason for the payment.
If you make payments using your bank ac-
count, you may be able to prove payment with 
an account statement.
Account statements. You may be able to 
prove payment with a legible financial account 
statement prepared by your bank or other finan-
cial institution.
Pay statements. You may have deductible ex-
penses withheld from your paycheck, such as 
medical insurance premiums. You should keep 
your year-end or final pay statements as proof 
of payment of these expenses.
How Long To Keep 
Records
You must keep your records as long as they 
may be needed for the administration of any 
provision of the Internal Revenue Code. Gener-
ally, this means you must keep records that 
support items shown on your return until the pe-
riod of limitations for that return runs out.
The period of limitations is the period of time 
in which you can amend your return to claim a 
credit or refund or the IRS can assess addi-
tional tax. Table 1-7 contains the periods of 
limitations that apply to income tax returns. Un-
less otherwise stated, the years refer to the pe-
riod beginning after the return was filed. Re-
turns filed before the due date are treated as 
being filed on the due date.
Period of Limitations
Table 1-7.
IF you...
THEN the
period is...
1 File a return and (2), 
(3), and (4) don't apply 
to you,
3 years.
2 Don't report income 
that you should and it is 
more than 25% of the 
gross income shown on 
your return,
6 years.
3 File a fraudulent return,
No limit.
4 Don't file a return,
No limit.
5 File a claim for credit or 
refund after you filed 
your return,
The later of 3 
years or 2 
years after tax 
was paid.
6 File a claim for a loss 
from worthless 
securities or bad debt 
deduction,
7 years.
Property. Keep records relating to property 
until the period of limitations expires for the year 
in which you dispose of the property in a taxa-
ble disposition. You must keep these records to 
figure your basis for computing gain or loss 
when you sell or otherwise dispose of the prop-
erty.
Generally, if you received property in a non-
taxable exchange, your basis in that property is 
the same as the basis of the property you gave 
up. You must keep the records on the old prop-
erty, as well as the new property, until the pe-
riod of limitations expires for the year in which 
you dispose of the new property in a taxable 
disposition.
Refund Information
You can go online to check the status of your 
2022 refund 24 hours after the IRS receives 
your e-filed return, or 4 weeks after you mail a 
paper return. If you filed Form 8379 with your 
return, allow 14 weeks (11 weeks if you filed 
electronically) before checking your refund sta-
tus. Be sure to have a copy of your 2022 tax re-
turn handy because you will need to know the 
filing status, the first SSN shown on the return, 
and the exact whole-dollar amount of the re-
fund. To check on your refund, do one of the 
following.
•
Go to IRS.gov/Refunds.
•
Download the free IRS2Go app to your 
smart phone and use it to check your re-
fund status.
•
Call the automated refund hotline at 
800-829-1954.
Interest on Refunds
If you are due a refund, you may get interest on 
it. The interest rates are adjusted quarterly.
If the refund is made within 45 days after the 
due date of your return, no interest will be paid. 
If you file your return after the due date (includ-
ing extensions), no interest will be paid if the re-
fund is made within 45 days after the date you 
filed. If the refund isn't made within this 45-day 
period, interest will be paid from the due date of 
the return or from the date you filed, whichever 
is later. 
Accepting a refund check doesn't change 
your right to claim an additional refund and in-
terest. File your claim within the period of time 
that applies. See Amended Returns and Claims 
for Refund, later. If you don't accept a refund 
check, no more interest will be paid on the over-
payment included in the check.
Interest on erroneous refund. All or part of 
any interest you were charged on an erroneous 
refund will generally be forgiven. Any interest 
charged for the period before demand for re-
payment was made will be forgiven unless:
1. You, or a person related to you, caused 
the erroneous refund in any way; or
2. The refund is more than $50,000.
For example, if you claimed a refund of $100 
on your return, but the IRS made an error and 
sent you $1,000, you wouldn't be charged inter-
est for the time you held the $900 difference. 
You must, however, repay the $900 when the 
IRS asks.
Change of Address
If you have moved, file your return using your 
new address.
If you move after you filed your return, you 
should give the IRS clear and concise notifica-
tion of your change of address. The notification 
may be written, electronic, or oral. Send written 
notification to the Internal Revenue Service 
Center serving your old address. You can use 
Form 8822, Change of Address. If you are ex-
pecting a refund, also notify the post office serv-
ing your old address. This will help in forwarding 
your check to your new address (unless you 
chose direct deposit of your refund). For more 
information, see Revenue Procedure 2010-16, 
2010-19 I.R.B. 664, available at IRS.gov/irb/
2010-19_IRB/ar07.html.
Be sure to include your SSN (and the name 
and SSN of your spouse if you filed a joint re-
turn) in any correspondence with the IRS.
What if I Made
a Mistake?
Errors may delay your refund or result in notices 
being sent to you. If you discover an error, you 
can file an amended return or claim for refund.
Amended Returns and
Claims for Refund
You should correct your return if, after you have 
filed it, you find that:
Chapter 1 Filing Information Page 17

1. You didn't report some income,
2. You claimed deductions or credits you 
shouldn't have claimed,
3. You didn't claim deductions or credits you 
could have claimed, or
4. You should have claimed a different filing 
status. (Once you file a joint return, you 
can’t choose to file separate returns for 
that year after the due date of the return. 
However, an executor may be able to 
make this change for a deceased spouse.)
If you need a copy of your return, see Copies of 
tax returns under Kinds of Records To Keep, 
earlier, in this chapter.
Form 1040-X. Use Form 1040-X to correct a 
return you have already filed.
Completing 
Form 
1040-X. On 
Form 
1040-X, enter your income, deductions, and 
credits as you originally reported them on your 
return; the changes you are making; and the 
corrected amounts. Then, figure the tax on the 
corrected amount of taxable income and the 
amount you owe or your refund.
If you owe tax, the IRS offers several pay-
ment options. See How To Pay, earlier. The tax 
owed won't be subtracted from any amount you 
had credited to your estimated tax.
If you can’t pay the full amount due with your 
return, you can ask to make monthly installment 
payments. See Installment Agreement, earlier.
If you overpaid tax, you can have all or part 
of the overpayment refunded to you, or you can 
apply all or part of it to your estimated tax. If you 
choose to get a refund, it will be sent separately 
from any refund shown on your original return.
Filing Form 1040-X. When completing 
Form 1040-X, don't forget to show the year of 
your original return and explain all changes you 
made. Be sure to attach any forms or schedules 
needed to explain your changes. Mail your 
Form 1040-X to the Internal Revenue Service 
Center serving the area where you now live (as 
shown in the Instructions for Form 1040-X). 
However, if you are filing Form 1040-X in re-
sponse to a notice you received from the IRS, 
mail it to the address shown on the notice.
File a separate form for each tax year in-
volved.
You can file Form 1040-X electronically to 
amend 2019 or later Forms 1040 and 1040-SR. 
For more information, see Instructions for Form 
1040-X.
Time for filing a claim for refund. Generally, 
you must file your claim for a credit or refund 
within 3 years after the date you filed your origi-
nal return or within 2 years after the date you 
paid the tax, whichever is later. Returns filed 
before the due date (without regard to exten-
sions) are considered filed on the due date 
(even if the due date was a Saturday, Sunday, 
or legal holiday). These time periods are sus-
pended while you are financially disabled, dis-
cussed later.
If the last day for claiming a credit or refund 
is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, you can 
file the claim on the next business day.
If you don't file a claim within this period, you 
may not be entitled to a credit or a refund.
Federally declared disaster. If you were 
affected by a federally declared disaster, you 
may have additional time to file your amended 
return. See Pub. 556 for details.
Protective claim for refund. Generally, a pro-
tective claim is a formal claim or amended re-
turn for credit or refund normally based on cur-
rent litigation or expected changes in tax law or 
other legislation. You file a protective claim 
when your right to a refund is contingent on fu-
ture events and may not be determinable until 
after the statute of limitations expires. A valid 
protective claim doesn't have to list a particular 
dollar amount or demand an immediate refund. 
However, a valid protective claim must:
•
Be in writing and signed;
•
Include your name, address, SSN or ITIN, 
and other contact information;
•
Identify and describe the contingencies af-
fecting the claim;
•
Clearly alert the IRS to the essential nature 
of the claim; and
•
Identify the specific year(s) for which a re-
fund is sought.
Mail your protective claim for refund to the ad-
dress listed in the Instructions for Form 1040-X 
under Where To File.
Generally, the IRS will delay action on the 
protective claim until the contingency is re-
solved.
Limit on amount of refund. If you file your 
claim within 3 years after the date you filed your 
return, the credit or refund can’t be more than 
the part of the tax paid within the 3-year period 
(plus any extension of time for filing your return) 
immediately before you filed the claim. This 
time period is suspended while you are finan-
cially disabled, discussed later.
Tax paid. Payments, including estimated 
tax payments, made before the due date (with-
out regard to extensions) of the original return 
are considered paid on the due date. For exam-
ple, income tax withheld during the year is con-
sidered paid on the due date of the return, 
which is April 15 for most taxpayers.
Example 1. You made estimated tax pay-
ments of $500 and got an automatic extension 
of time to October 15, 2019, to file your 2018 in-
come tax return. When you filed your return on 
that date, you paid an additional $200 tax. On 
October 15, 2022, you filed an amended return 
and claimed a refund of $700. Because you 
filed your claim within 3 years after you filed 
your original return, you can get a refund of up 
to $700, the tax paid within the 3 years plus the 
6-month extension period immediately before 
you filed the claim.
Example 2. The situation is the same as in 
Example 1, except you filed your return on Oc-
tober 30, 2019, 2 weeks after the extension pe-
riod ended. You paid an additional $200 on that 
date. On October 31, 2022, you filed an amen-
ded return and claimed a refund of $700. Al-
though you filed your claim within 3 years from 
the date you filed your original return, the refund 
was limited to $200, the tax paid within the 3 
years plus the 6-month extension period imme-
diately before you filed the claim. The estimated 
tax of $500 paid before that period can’t be re-
funded or credited.
If you file a claim more than 3 years after you 
file your return, the credit or refund can’t be 
more than the tax you paid within the 2 years 
immediately before you file the claim.
Example. You filed your 2018 tax return on 
April 15, 2019. You paid taxes of $500. On No-
vember 5, 2020, after an examination of your 
2018 return, you had to pay an additional tax of 
$200. On May 12, 2022, you file a claim for a re-
fund of $300. However, because you filed your 
claim more than 3 years after you filed your re-
turn, your refund will be limited to the $200 you 
paid during the 2 years immediately before you 
filed your claim.
Financially disabled. The time periods for 
claiming a refund are suspended for the period 
in which you are financially disabled. For a joint 
income tax return, only one spouse has to be fi-
nancially disabled for the time period to be sus-
pended. You are financially disabled if you are 
unable to manage your financial affairs because 
of a medically determinable physical or mental 
impairment that can be expected to result in 
death or that has lasted or can be expected to 
last for a continuous period of not less than 12 
months. However, you aren’t treated as finan-
cially disabled during any period your spouse or 
any other person is authorized to act on your 
behalf in financial matters.
To claim that you are financially disabled, 
you must send in the following written state-
ments with your claim for refund.
1. A statement from your qualified physician 
that includes:
a. The name and a description of your 
physical or mental impairment;
b. The physician's medical opinion that 
the impairment prevented you from 
managing your financial affairs;
c. The physician's medical opinion that 
the impairment was or can be expec-
ted to result in death, or that its dura-
tion has lasted, or can be expected to 
last, at least 12 months;
d. The specific time period (to the best of 
the physician's knowledge); and
e. The following certification signed by 
the physician: “I hereby certify that, to 
the best of my knowledge and belief, 
the above representations are true, 
correct, and complete.”
2. A statement made by the person signing 
the claim for credit or refund that no per-
son, including your spouse, was author-
ized to act on your behalf in financial mat-
ters during the period of disability (or the 
exact dates that a person was authorized 
to act for you).
Exceptions for special types of refunds. If 
you file a claim for one of the items in the follow-
ing list, the dates and limits discussed earlier 
may not apply. These items, and where to get 
more information, are as follows.
•
Bad debt. See Pub. 550.

Claim based on an agreement with the IRS 
extending the period for assessment of 
tax. 
Processing claims for refund. Claims are 
usually processed 8–12 weeks after they are 
filed. Your claim may be accepted as filed, dis-
allowed, or subject to examination. If a claim is 
examined, the procedures are the same as in 
the examination of a tax return.
If your claim is disallowed, you will receive 
an explanation of why it was disallowed.
Taking your claim to court. You can sue for a 
refund in court, but you must first file a timely 
claim with the IRS. If the IRS disallows your 
claim or doesn't act on your claim within 6 
months after you file it, you can then take your 
claim to court. For information on the burden of 
proof in a court proceeding, see Pub. 556.
The IRS provides a direct method to move 
your claim to court if:
•
You are filing a claim for a credit or refund 
based solely on contested income tax or 
on estate tax or gift tax issues considered 
in your previously examined returns, and
•
You want to take your case to court instead 
of appealing it within the IRS.
When you file your claim with the IRS, you 
get the direct method by requesting in writing 
that your claim be immediately rejected. A no-
tice of claim disallowance will be sent to you.
You have 2 years from the date of mailing of 
the notice of claim disallowance to file a refund 
suit in the U.S. District Court having jurisdiction 
or in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.
Interest on refund. If you receive a refund be-
cause of your amended return, interest will be 
paid on it from the due date of your original re-
turn or the date you filed your original return, 
whichever is later, to the date you filed the 
amended return. However, if the refund isn't 
made within 45 days after you file the amended 
return, interest will be paid up to the date the re-
fund is paid.
Reduced refund. Your refund may be reduced 
by an additional tax liability that has been as-
sessed against you.
Also, your refund may be reduced by 
amounts you owe for past-due federal tax, state 
income tax, state unemployment compensation 
debts, child support, spousal support, or certain 
other federal nontax debts, such as student 
loans. If your spouse owes these debts, see 
Offset against debts under Refunds, earlier, for 
the correct refund procedures to follow.
Effect on state tax liability. If your return is 
changed for any reason, it may affect your state 
income tax liability. This includes changes 
made as a result of an examination of your re-
turn by the IRS. Contact your state tax agency 
for more information.
Penalties
The law provides penalties for failure to file re-
turns or pay taxes as required.
Civil Penalties
If you don't file your return and pay your tax by 
the due date, you may have to pay a penalty. 
You may also have to pay a penalty if you sub-
stantially understate your tax, understate a re-
portable transaction, file an erroneous claim for 
refund or credit, file a frivolous tax submission, 
or fail to supply your SSN or ITIN. If you provide 
fraudulent information on your return, you may 
have to pay a civil fraud penalty.
Filing late. If you don't file your return by the 
due date (including extensions), you may have 
to pay a failure-to-file penalty. The penalty is 
usually 5% for each month or part of a month 
that a return is late, but not more than 25%. The 
penalty is based on the tax not paid by the due 
date (without regard to extensions).
Fraud. If your failure to file is due to fraud, 
the penalty is 15% for each month or part of a 
month that your return is late, up to a maximum 
of 75%.
Return over 60 days late. If you file your 
return more than 60 days after the due date, or 
extended due date, the minimum penalty is the 
smaller of $450 or 100% of the unpaid tax.
Exception. You won't have to pay the pen-
alty if you show that you failed to file on time be-
cause of reasonable cause and not because of 
willful neglect.
Paying tax late. You will have to pay a fail-
ure-to-pay penalty of 1/2 of 1% (0.50%) of your 
unpaid taxes for each month, or part of a month, 
after the due date that the tax isn't paid. This 
penalty doesn't apply during the automatic 
6-month extension of time to file period if you 
paid at least 90% of your actual tax liability on 
or before the due date of your return and pay 
the balance when you file the return.
The monthly rate of the failure-to-pay pen-
alty is half the usual rate (0.25% instead of 
0.50%) if an installment agreement is in effect 
for that month. You must have filed your return 
by the due date (including extensions) to qualify 
for this reduced penalty.
If a notice of intent to levy is issued, the rate 
will increase to 1% at the start of the first month 
beginning at least 10 days after the day that the 
notice is issued. If a notice and demand for im-
mediate payment is issued, the rate will in-
crease to 1% at the start of the first month be-
ginning after the day that the notice and 
demand is issued.
This penalty can’t be more than 25% of your 
unpaid tax. You won't have to pay the penalty if 
you can show that you had a good reason for 
not paying your tax on time.
Combined penalties. If both the failure-to-file 
penalty and the failure-to-pay penalty (dis-
cussed earlier) apply in any month, the 5% (or 
15%) failure-to-file penalty is reduced by the 
failure-to-pay penalty. However, if you file your 
return more than 60 days after the due date or 
extended due date, the minimum penalty is the 
smaller of $450 or 100% of the unpaid tax.
Accuracy-related penalty. You may have to 
pay an accuracy-related penalty if you under-
pay your tax because:
1. You show negligence or disregard of the 
rules or regulations,
2. You substantially understate your income 
tax,
3. You claim tax benefits for a transaction 
that lacks economic substance, or
4. You fail to disclose a foreign financial as-
set.
The penalty is equal to 20% of the underpay-
ment. The penalty is 40% of any portion of the 
underpayment that is attributable to an undis-
closed noneconomic substance transaction or 
an undisclosed foreign financial asset transac-
tion. The penalty won't be figured on any part of 
an underpayment on which the fraud penalty 
(discussed later) is charged.
Negligence or disregard. The term “negli-
gence” includes a failure to make a reasonable 
attempt to comply with the tax law or to exercise 
ordinary and reasonable care in preparing a re-
turn. Negligence also includes failure to keep 
adequate books and records. You won't have to 
pay a negligence penalty if you have a reasona-
ble basis for a position you took.
The term “disregard” includes any careless, 
reckless, or intentional disregard.
Adequate disclosure. You can avoid the 
penalty for disregard of rules or regulations if 
you adequately disclose on your return a posi-
tion that has at least a reasonable basis. See 
Disclosure statement, later.
This exception won't apply to an item that is 
attributable to a tax shelter. In addition, it won't 
apply if you fail to keep adequate books and re-
cords, or substantiate items properly.
Substantial understatement of income 
tax. You understate your tax if the tax shown 
on your return is less than the correct tax. The 
understatement is substantial if it is more than 
the larger of 10% of the correct tax or $5,000. 
However, the amount of the understatement 
may be reduced to the extent the understate-
ment is due to:
1. Substantial authority, or
2. Adequate disclosure and a reasonable ba-
sis.
If an item on your return is attributable to a tax 
shelter, there is no reduction for an adequate 
disclosure. However, there is a reduction for a 
position with substantial authority, but only if 
you reasonably believed that your tax treatment 
was more likely than not the proper treatment.
Substantial authority. Whether there is or 
was substantial authority for the tax treatment of 
an item depends on the facts and circumstan-
ces. Some of the items that may be considered 
are court opinions, Treasury regulations, reve-
nue rulings, revenue procedures, and notices 
and announcements issued by the IRS and 
published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin that 
involve the same or similar circumstances as 
yours.
Disclosure statement. To adequately dis-
close the relevant facts about your tax 
Chapter 1 Filing Information Page 19

treatment of an item, use Form 8275. You must 
also have a reasonable basis for treating the 
item the way you did.
In cases of substantial understatement only, 
items that meet the requirements of Revenue 
Procedure 2021-52 (or later update) are consid-
ered adequately disclosed on your return with-
out filing Form 8275. 
Use Form 8275-R to disclose items or posi-
tions contrary to regulations.
Transaction 
lacking 
economic 
sub-
stance. For more information on economic 
substance, see section 7701(o).
Foreign financial asset. For more informa-
tion on undisclosed foreign financial assets, see 
section 6662(j).
Reasonable cause. You won't have to pay 
a penalty if you show a good reason (reasona-
ble cause) for the way you treated an item. You 
must also show that you acted in good faith. 
This doesn't apply to a transaction that lacks 
economic substance.
Filing erroneous claim for refund or credit. 
You may have to pay a penalty if you file an er-
roneous claim for refund or credit. The penalty 
is equal to 20% of the disallowed amount of the 
claim, unless you can show a reasonable basis 
for the way you treated an item. However, any 
disallowed amount due to a transaction that 
lacks economic substance won't be treated as 
having a reasonable basis. The penalty won't 
be figured on any part of the disallowed amount 
of the claim that relates to the earned income 
credit or on which the accuracy-related or fraud 
penalties are charged.
Frivolous tax submission. You may have to 
pay a penalty of $5,000 if you file a frivolous tax 
return or other frivolous submissions. A frivo-
lous tax return is one that doesn't include 
enough information to figure the correct tax or 
that contains information clearly showing that 
the tax you reported is substantially incorrect. 
For more information on frivolous returns, frivo-
lous submissions, and a list of positions that are 
identified as frivolous, see Notice 2010-33, 
2010-17 I.R.B. 609, available at IRS.gov/irb/
2010-17_IRB/ar13.html.
You will have to pay the penalty if you filed 
this kind of return or submission based on a friv-
olous position or a desire to delay or interfere 
with the administration of federal tax laws. This 
includes altering or striking out the preprinted 
language above the space provided for your 
signature.
This penalty is added to any other penalty 
provided by law.
Fraud. If there is any underpayment of tax on 
your return due to fraud, a penalty of 75% of the 
underpayment due to fraud will be added to 
your tax.
Joint return. The fraud penalty on a joint re-
turn doesn't apply to a spouse unless some part 
of the underpayment is due to the fraud of that 
spouse.
Failure to supply SSN. If you don't include 
your SSN or the SSN of another person where 
required on a return, statement, or other docu-
ment, you will be subject to a penalty of $50 for 
each failure. You will also be subject to a pen-
alty of $50 if you don't give your SSN to another 
person when it is required on a return, state-
ment, or other document.
For example, if you have a bank account 
that earns interest, you must give your SSN to 
the bank. The number must be shown on the 
Form 1099-INT or other statement the bank 
sends you. If you don't give the bank your SSN, 
you will be subject to the $50 penalty. (You may 
also be subject to “backup” withholding of in-
come tax. See chapter 4.)
You won't have to pay the penalty if you are 
able to show that the failure was due to reason-
able cause and not willful neglect.
Criminal Penalties
You may be subject to criminal prosecution 
(brought to trial) for actions such as:
1. Tax evasion;
2. Willful failure to file a return, supply infor-
mation, or pay any tax due;
3. Fraud and false statements;
4. Preparing and filing a fraudulent return; or
5. Identity theft.
Identity Theft
Identity theft occurs when someone uses your 
personal information such as your name, SSN, 
or other identifying information, without your 
permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. An 
identity thief may use your SSN to get a job or 
may file a tax return using your SSN to receive 
a refund.
To reduce your risk:
•
Protect your SSN,
•
Ensure your employer is protecting your 
SSN, and
•
Be careful when choosing a tax preparer.
If your tax records are affected by identity 
theft and you receive a notice from the IRS, re-
spond right away to the name and phone num-
ber printed on the IRS notice or letter.
If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you 
suspect you are a victim of tax-related identity 
theft, visit IRS.gov/IdentityTheft to learn what 
steps you should take.
For more information, see Pub. 5027.
All taxpayers are now eligible for an 
Identity Protection Personal Identifica-
tion Number (IP PIN). For more infor-
mation, see Pub. 5477. To apply for an IP PIN, 
go to IRS.gov/IPPIN and use the Get an IP PIN 
tool.
Victims of identity theft who are experienc-
ing economic harm or a systemic problem, or 
are seeking help in resolving tax problems that 
have not been resolved through normal chan-
nels, may be eligible for Taxpayer Advocate 
Service (TAS) assistance. You can reach TAS 
by calling the National Taxpayer Advocate help-
line at 877-777-4778 or 800-829-4059 (TTY/
TDD). Deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals can 
also contact the IRS through the Telecommuni-
cations Relay Services (TRS) at FCC.gov/TRS.
Protect yourself from suspicious emails 
or phishing schemes. Phishing is the crea-
tion and use of email and websites designed to 
TIP
mimic legitimate business emails and websites. 
The most common form is the act of sending an 
email to a user falsely claiming to be an estab-
lished legitimate enterprise in an attempt to 
scam the user into surrendering private informa-
tion that will be used for identity theft.
The IRS doesn't initiate contacts with tax-
payers via emails. Also, the IRS doesn't request 
detailed personal information through email or 
ask taxpayers for the PIN numbers, passwords, 
or similar secret access information for their 
credit card, bank, or other financial accounts.
If you receive an unsolicited email claiming 
to be from the IRS, forward the message to 
phishing@irs.gov. You may also report misuse 
of the IRS name, logo, forms, or other IRS prop-
erty to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax 
Administration toll free at 800-366-4484. You 
can forward suspicious emails to the Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC) at spam@uce.gov or 
report them at ftc.gov/complaint. You can con-
tact them at ftc.gov/idtheft or 877-IDTHEFT 
(877-438-4338). If you have been a victim of 
identity theft, see IdentityTheft.gov or Pub. 
5027. People who are deaf, hard of hearing, or 
have a speech disability and who have access 
to TTY/TDD equipment can call 866-653-4261.
Go to IRS.gov/IDProtection to learn more 
about identity theft and how to reduce your risk.

Filing Status
Introduction
This chapter helps you determine which filing 
status to use. There are five filing statuses.
•
Single.
•
Married Filing Jointly.
•
Married Filing Separately.
•
Head of Household.
•
Qualifying Surviving Spouse.
If more than one filing status applies to 
you, choose the one that will give you 
the lowest tax.
You must determine your filing status before 
you can determine whether you must file a tax 
return (chapter 1), your standard deduction 
(chapter 10), and your tax (chapter 11). You 
also use your filing status to determine whether 
you are eligible to claim certain deductions and 
credits.

Forms.
Marital Status
In general, your filing status depends on 
whether you are considered unmarried or mar-
ried.
Unmarried persons. You are considered un-
married for the whole year if, on the last day of 
your tax year, you are either:
•
Unmarried, or
•
Legally separated from your spouse under 
a divorce or separate maintenance decree.
State law governs whether you are married 
or legally separated under a divorce or separate 
maintenance decree.
Divorced persons. If you are divorced un-
der a final decree by the last day of the year, 
you are considered unmarried for the whole 
year.
Divorce and remarriage. If you obtain a di-
vorce for the sole purpose of filing tax returns as 
unmarried individuals, and at the time of divorce 
you intend to and do, in fact, remarry each other 
in the next tax year, you and your spouse must 
file as married individuals in both years.
Annulled marriages. If you obtain a court 
decree of annulment, which holds that no valid 
marriage ever existed, you are considered un-
married even if you filed joint returns for earlier 
years. File Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Indi-
vidual Income Tax Return, claiming single or 
head of household status for all tax years that 
are affected by the annulment and not closed 
by the statute of limitations for filing a tax return. 
Generally, for a credit or refund, you must file 
Form 1040-X within 3 years (including exten-
sions) after the date you filed your original re-
turn or within 2 years after the date you paid the 
tax, whichever is later. If you filed your original 
return early (for example, March 1), your return 
is considered filed on the due date (generally 
April 15). However, if you had an extension to 
file (for example, until October 15) but you filed 
earlier and we received it on July 1, your return 
is considered filed on July 1.
Head of household or qualifying surviv-
ing spouse. If you are considered unmarried, 
you may be able to file as head of household or 
as qualifying surviving spouse. See Head of 
Household and Qualifying Surviving Spouse, 
later, to see if you qualify.
Married persons. If you are considered mar-
ried, you and your spouse can file a joint return 
or separate returns.
Considered married. You are considered 
married for the whole year if, on the last day of 
your tax year, you and your spouse meet any 
one of the following tests.
  519
  555
  559
  596
  925
1. You are married and living together.
2. You are living together in a common law 
marriage recognized in the state where 
you now live or in the state where the com-
mon law marriage began.
3. You are married and living apart, but not 
legally separated under a decree of di-
vorce or separate maintenance.
4. You are separated under an interlocutory 
(not final) decree of divorce.
Spouse died during the year. If your 
spouse died during the year, you are consid-
ered married for the whole year for filing status 
purposes.
If you didn't remarry before the end of the 
tax year, you can file a joint return for yourself 
and your deceased spouse. For the next 2 
years, you may be entitled to the special bene-
fits described later under Qualifying Surviving 
Spouse.
If you remarried before the end of the tax 
year, you can file a joint return with your new 
spouse. Your deceased spouse's filing status is 
married filing separately for that year.
Married persons living apart. If you live 
apart from your spouse and meet certain tests, 
you may be able to file as head of household 
even if you aren't divorced or legally separated. 
If you qualify to file as head of household in-
stead of married filing separately, your standard 
deduction will be higher. Also, your tax may be 
lower, and you may be able to claim the earned 
income credit. See Head of Household, later.
Single
Your filing status is single if you are considered 
unmarried and you don’t qualify for another fil-
ing status. To determine your marital status, 
see Marital Status, earlier.
Spouse died before January 1, 2022. Your 
filing status may be single if your spouse died 
before January 1, 2022, and you didn't remarry 
before the end of 2022. You may, however, be 
able to use another filing status that will give 
you a lower tax. See Head of Household and 
Qualifying Surviving Spouse, later, to see if you 
qualify. 
How to file. On Form 1040 or 1040-SR, show 
your filing status as single by checking the “Sin-
gle” box on the Filing Status line at the top of 
the form. Use the Single column of the Tax Ta-
ble, or Section A of the Tax Computation Work-
sheet, to figure your tax.
Married Filing Jointly
You can choose married filing jointly as your fil-
ing status if you are considered married and 
both you and your spouse agree to file a joint 
return. On a joint return, you and your spouse 
report your combined income and deduct your 
combined allowable expenses. You can file a 
joint return even if one of you had no income or 
deductions.
If you and your spouse decide to file a joint 
return, your tax may be lower than your com-
bined tax for the other filing statuses. Also, your 
standard deduction (if you don’t itemize 
deductions) may be higher, and you may qualify 
for tax benefits that don’t apply to other filing 
statuses.
How to file. On Form 1040 or 1040-SR, show 
your filing status as married filing jointly by 
checking the “Married filing jointly” box on the 
Filing Status line at the top of the form. Use the 
Married filing jointly column of the Tax Table, or 
Section B of the Tax Computation Worksheet, 
to figure your tax.
If you and your spouse each have in-
come, you may want to figure your tax 
both on a joint return and on separate 
returns (using the filing status of married filing 
separately). You can choose the method that 
gives the two of you the lower combined tax un-
less you are required to file separately.
Spouse died. If your spouse died during the 
year, you are considered married for the whole 
year and can choose married filing jointly as 
your filing status. See Spouse died during the 
year, under Married persons, earlier, for more 
information.
If your spouse died in 2023 before filing a 
2022 return, you can choose married filing 
jointly as your filing status on your 2022 return.
Divorced persons. If you are divorced under a 
final decree by the last day of the year, you are 
considered unmarried for the whole year and 
you can’t choose married filing jointly as your fil-
ing status.
Filing a Joint Return
Both you and your spouse must include all of 
your income and deductions on your joint re-
turn.
Accounting period. Both of you must use the 
same accounting period, but you can use differ-
ent accounting methods. See Accounting Peri-
ods and Accounting Methods in chapter 1.
Joint responsibility. Both of you may be held 
responsible, jointly and individually, for the tax 
and any interest or penalty due on your joint re-
turn. This means that if one spouse doesn't pay 
the tax due, the other may have to. Or, if one 
spouse doesn't report the correct tax, both 
spouses may be responsible for any additional 
taxes assessed by the IRS. One spouse may 
be held responsible for all the tax due even if all 
the income was earned by the other spouse.
You may want to file separately if:
•
You believe your spouse isn't reporting all 
of their income, or
•
You don’t want to be responsible for any 
taxes due if your spouse doesn't have 
enough tax withheld or doesn't pay enough 
estimated tax.
Divorced taxpayer. You may be held jointly 
and individually responsible for any tax, inter-
est, and penalties due on a joint return filed be-
fore your divorce. This responsibility may apply 
even if your divorce decree states that your for-
mer spouse will be responsible for any amounts 
due on previously filed joint returns.
Relief from joint responsibility. In some 
cases, one spouse may be relieved of joint re-
sponsibility for tax, interest, and penalties on a 
TIP
Chapter 2 Filing Status Page 21

joint return for items of the other spouse that 
were incorrectly reported on the joint return. 
You can ask for relief no matter how small the 
liability.
There are three types of relief available.
1. Innocent spouse relief.
2. Separation of liability (available only to 
joint filers whose spouse has died, or who 
are divorced, legally separated, or haven't 
lived together for the 12 months ending on 
the date the election for this relief is filed).
3. Equitable relief.
You must file Form 8857, Request for Inno-
cent Spouse Relief, to request relief from joint 
responsibility. Pub. 971, Innocent Spouse Re-
lief, explains these kinds of relief and who may 
qualify for them.
Signing a joint return. For a return to be con-
sidered a joint return, both spouses must gener-
ally sign the return.
Spouse died before signing. If your 
spouse died before signing the return, the exec-
utor or administrator must sign the return for 
your spouse. If neither you nor anyone else has 
yet been appointed as executor or administra-
tor, you can sign the return for your spouse and 
enter “Filing as surviving spouse” in the area 
where you sign the return.
Spouse away from home. If your spouse is 
away from home, you should prepare the re-
turn, sign it, and send it to your spouse to sign 
so that it can be filed on time.
Injury or disease prevents signing. If your 
spouse can’t sign because of disease or injury 
and tells you to sign for them, you can sign your 
spouse’s name in the proper space on the re-
turn followed by the words “By (your name), 
Spouse.” Be sure to sign in the space provided 
for your signature. Attach a dated statement, 
signed by you, to the return. The statement 
should include the form number of the return 
you are filing, the tax year, and the reason your 
spouse can’t sign; it should also state that your 
spouse has agreed to your signing for them.
Signing as guardian of spouse. If you are 
the guardian of your spouse who is mentally in-
competent, you can sign the return for your 
spouse as guardian.
Spouse in combat zone. You can sign a 
joint return for your spouse if your spouse can’t 
sign because they are serving in a combat zone 
(such as the Persian Gulf Area, Serbia, Monte-
negro, Albania, or Afghanistan), even if you 
don’t have a power of attorney or other state-
ment. Attach a signed statement to your return 
explaining that your spouse is serving in a com-
bat zone. For more information on special tax 
rules for persons who are serving in a combat 
zone, or who are in missing status as a result of 
serving in a combat zone, see Pub. 3, Armed 
Forces' Tax Guide.
Power of attorney. In order for you to sign a 
return for your spouse in any of these cases, 
you must attach to the return a power of attor-
ney (POA) that authorizes you to sign for your 
spouse. You can use a POA that states that you 
have been granted authority to sign the return, 
or you can use Form 2848. Part I of Form 2848 
must state that you are granted authority to sign 
the return.
Nonresident alien or dual-status alien. Gen-
erally, a married couple can’t file a joint return if 
either one is a nonresident alien at any time 
during the tax year. However, if one spouse 
was a nonresident alien or dual-status alien 
who was married to a U.S. citizen or resident 
alien at the end of the year, the spouses can 
choose to file a joint return. If you do file a joint 
return, you and your spouse are both treated as 
U.S. residents for the entire tax year. See chap-
ter 1 of Pub. 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.
Married Filing 
Separately
You can choose married filing separately as 
your filing status if you are married. This filing 
status may benefit you if you want to be respon-
sible only for your own tax or if it results in less 
tax than filing a joint return.
If you and your spouse don’t agree to file a 
joint return, you must use this filing status un-
less you qualify for head of household status, 
discussed later.
You may be able to choose head of house-
hold filing status if you are considered unmar-
ried because you live apart from your spouse 
and meet certain tests (explained under Head 
of Household, later). This can apply to you even 
if you aren't divorced or legally separated. If you 
qualify to file as head of household, instead of 
as married filing separately, your tax may be 
lower, you may be able to claim the earned in-
come credit and certain other benefits, and your 
standard deduction will be higher. The head of 
household filing status allows you to choose the 
standard deduction even if your spouse choo-
ses to itemize deductions. See Head of House-
hold, later, for more information.
You will generally pay more combined 
tax on separate returns than you would 
on a joint return for the reasons listed 
under Special Rules, later. However, unless 
you are required to file separately, you should 
figure your tax both ways (on a joint return and 
on separate returns). This way, you can make 
sure you are using the filing status that results in 
the lowest combined tax. When figuring the 
combined tax of a married couple, you may 
want to consider state taxes as well as federal 
taxes.
How to file. If you file a separate return, you 
generally report only your own income, credits, 
and deductions.
Select this filing status by checking the 
“Married filing separately” box on the Filing Sta-
tus line at the top of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. En-
ter your spouse's full name and SSN or ITIN in 
the entry space at the bottom of the Filing Sta-
tus section. If your spouse doesn't have and 
isn't required to have an SSN or ITIN, enter 
“NRA” in the space for your spouse's SSN. Use 
the Married filing separately column of the Tax 
Table, or Section C of the Tax Computation 
Worksheet, to figure your tax.
TIP
Special Rules
If you choose married filing separately as your 
filing status, the following special rules apply. 
Because of these special rules, you usually pay 
more tax on a separate return than if you use 
another filing status you qualify for.
1. Your tax rate is generally higher than on a 
joint return.
2. Your exemption amount for figuring the al-
ternative minimum tax is half that allowed 
on a joint return.
3. You can’t take the credit for child and de-
pendent care expenses in most cases, 
and the amount you can exclude from in-
come under an employer's dependent 
care assistance program is limited to 
$2,500 (instead of $5,000 on a joint re-
turn). However, if you are legally separa-
ted or living apart from your spouse, you 
may be able to file a separate return and 
still take the credit. For more information 
about these expenses, the credit, and the 
exclusion, see What’s Your Filing Status? 
in Pub. 503, Child and Dependent Care 
Expenses.
4. You can’t take the earned income credit, 
unless you were separated from your 
spouse at the end of 2022 and meet cer-
tain requirements. For more information 
about these requirements, see Rule 3—If 
Your Filing Status is Married Filing Sepa-
rately, You Must Meet Certain Rules in 
Pub. 596, Earned Income Credit (EIC).
5. You can’t take the exclusion or credit for 
adoption expenses in most cases.
6. You can’t take the education credits (the 
American opportunity credit and lifetime 
learning credit), or the deduction for stu-
dent loan interest.
7. You can’t exclude any interest income 
from qualified U.S. savings bonds you 
used for higher education expenses.
8. If you lived with your spouse at any time 
during the tax year:
a. You can’t claim the credit for the eld-
erly or the disabled, and
b. You must include in income a greater 
percentage (up to 85%) of any social 
security or equivalent railroad retire-
ment benefits you received.
9. The following credits and deductions are 
reduced at income levels half of those for 
a joint return:
a. The child tax credit and the credit for 
other dependents, and
b. The retirement savings contributions 
credit.
10. Your capital loss deduction limit is $1,500 
(instead of $3,000 on a joint return). 
11. If your spouse itemizes deductions, you 
can’t claim the standard deduction. If you 
can claim the standard deduction, your 
basic standard deduction is half of the 
amount allowed on a joint return.
Page 22 Chapter 2 Filing Status

Adjusted gross income (AGI) limits. If your 
AGI on a separate return is lower than it would 
have been on a joint return, you may be able to 
deduct a larger amount for certain deductions 
that are limited by AGI, such as medical expen-
ses.
Individual retirement arrangements (IRAs). 
You may not be able to deduct all or part of your 
contributions to a traditional IRA if you or your 
spouse were covered by an employee retire-
ment plan at work during the year. Your deduc-
tion is reduced or eliminated if your income is 
more than a certain amount. This amount is 
much lower for married individuals who file sep-
arately and lived together at any time during the 
year. For more information, see How Much Can 
You Deduct in chapter 9.
Rental activity losses. If you actively partici-
pated in a passive rental real estate activity that 
produced a loss, you can generally deduct the 
loss from your nonpassive income, up to 
$25,000. This is called a “special allowance.” 
However, married persons filing separate re-
turns who lived together at any time during the 
year can’t claim this special allowance. Married 
persons filing separate returns who lived apart 
at all times during the year are each allowed a 
$12,500 maximum special allowance for losses 
from passive real estate activities. See Rental 
Activities in Pub. 925, Passive Activity and 
At-Risk Rules, for more information.
Community property states. If you live in a 
community property state and file separately, 
your income may be considered separate in-
come or community income for income tax pur-
poses. Community property states include Ari-
zona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, 
New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wiscon-
sin. See Pub. 555, Community Property, for 
more information.
Joint Return After
Separate Returns
You can change your filing status from a sepa-
rate return to a joint return by filing an amended 
return using Form 1040-X.
You can generally change to a joint return 
any time within 3 years from the due date of the 
separate return or returns. This doesn't include 
any extensions. A separate return includes a re-
turn filed by you or your spouse claiming mar-
ried filing separately, single, or head of house-
hold filing status.
Separate Returns After
Joint Return
Once you file a joint return, you can’t choose to 
file separate returns for that year after the due 
date of the return.
Exception. A personal representative for a de-
cedent can change from a joint return elected 
by the surviving spouse to a separate return for 
the decedent. The personal representative has 
1 year from the due date (including extensions) 
of the return to make the change. See Pub. 559, 
Survivors, Executors, and Administrators, for 
more information on filing a return for a dece-
dent.
Head of Household
You may be able to file as head of household if 
you meet all of the following requirements.
1. You are unmarried or considered unmar-
ried on the last day of the year. See Mari-
tal Status, earlier, and Considered Unmar-
ried, later.
2. You paid more than half of the cost of 
keeping up a home for the year.
3. A qualifying person lived with you in the 
home for more than half the year (except 
for temporary absences, such as school). 
However, if the qualifying person is your 
dependent parent, your dependent parent 
doesn't have to live with you. See Special 
rule for parent, later, under Qualifying Per-
son.
If you qualify to file as head of house-
hold, your tax rate will usually be lower 
than the rates for single or married fil-
ing separately. You will also receive a higher 
standard deduction than if you file as single or 
married filing separately.
How to file. Indicate your choice of this filing 
status by checking the “Head of household” box 
on the Filing Status line at the top of Form 1040 
or 1040-SR. If the child who qualifies you for 
this filing status isn't claimed as your dependent 
in the Dependents section of Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, enter the child's name in the entry 
space at the bottom of the Filing Status section. 
Use the Head of a household column of the Tax 
Table, or Section D of the Tax Computation 
Worksheet, to figure your tax.
Considered Unmarried
To qualify for head of household status, you 
must be either unmarried or considered unmar-
ried on the last day of the year. You are consid-
ered unmarried on the last day of the tax year if 
you meet all of the following tests.
1. You file a separate return. A separate re-
turn includes a return claiming married fil-
ing separately, single, or head of house-
hold filing status.
2. You paid more than half of the cost of 
keeping up your home for the tax year.
3. Your spouse didn't live in your home dur-
ing the last 6 months of the tax year. Your 
spouse is considered to live in your home 
even if your spouse is temporarily absent 
due to special circumstances. See Tem-
porary absences under Qualifying Person, 
later.
4. Your home was the main home of your 
child, stepchild, or foster child for more 
than half the year. (See Home of qualifying 
person under Qualifying Person, later, for 
rules applying to a child's birth, death, or 
temporary absence during the year.)
5. You must be able to claim the child as a 
dependent. However, you meet this test if 
you can’t claim the child as a dependent 
only because the noncustodial parent can 
claim the child using the rules described in 
TIP
Children of divorced or separated parents 
(or parents who live apart) under Qualify-
ing Child in chapter 3, or referred to in 
Support Test for Children of Divorced or 
Separated Parents (or Parents Who Live 
Apart) under Qualifying Relative in chap-
ter 3. The general rules for claiming a child 
as a dependent are explained in chap-
ter 3.
If you were considered married for part 
of the year and lived in a community 
property state (listed earlier under Mar-
ried Filing Separately), special rules may apply 
in determining your income and expenses. See 
Pub. 555 for more information.
Nonresident alien spouse. You are consid-
ered unmarried for head of household purposes 
if your spouse was a nonresident alien at any 
time during the year and you don’t choose to 
treat your nonresident spouse as a resident 
alien. However, your spouse isn't a qualifying 
person for head of household purposes. You 
must have another qualifying person and meet 
the other tests to be eligible to file as head of 
household. 
Choice to treat spouse as resident. You 
are considered married if you choose to treat 
your spouse as a resident alien. See chapter 1 
of Pub. 519.
Keeping Up a Home
To qualify for head of household status, you 
must pay more than half of the cost of keeping 
up a home for the year. You can determine 
whether you paid more than half of the cost of 
keeping up a home by using Worksheet 2-1.
Costs you include. Include in the cost of 
keeping up a home expenses, such as rent, 
mortgage interest, real estate taxes, insurance 
on the home, repairs, utilities, and food eaten in 
the home.
Costs you don’t include. Don’t include the 
costs of clothing, education, medical treatment, 
vacations, life insurance, or transportation. Also 
don’t include the value of your services or those 
of a member of your household.
Qualifying Person
See Table 2-1 to see who is a qualifying person. 
Any person not described in Table 2-1 isn't a 
qualifying person.
Example 1—Child. Your unmarried child 
lived with you all year and was 18 years old at 
the end of the year. Your child didn't provide 
more than half of their own support and doesn't 
meet the tests to be a qualifying child of anyone 
else. As a result, this child is your qualifying 
child (see Qualifying Child in chapter 3) and, 
because this child is single, your qualifying per-
son for head of household purposes.
Example 2—Child who isn't qualifying 
person. The facts are the same as in Exam-
ple 1, except your child was 25 years old at the 
end of the year and your child’s gross income 
was $5,000. Because your child doesn't meet 
the age test (explained under Qualifying Child 
CAUTION
!
Chapter 2 Filing Status Page 23

in chapter 3), your child isn't your qualifying 
child. Because the child doesn't meet the gross 
income test (explained under Qualifying Rela-
tive in chapter 3), the child isn't your qualifying 
relative. As a result, this child isn't your qualify-
ing person for head of household purposes.
Example 3—Friend. Your friend lived with 
you all year. Even though your friend may be 
your qualifying relative if the gross income and 
support tests (explained in chapter 3) are met, 
your friend isn't your qualifying person for head 
of household purposes because your friend isn't 
related to you in one of the ways listed under 
Relatives who don’t have to live with you in 
chapter 3. See Table 2-1.
Example 4—Friend's child. The facts are 
the same as in Example 3, except your friend's 
10-year-old child also lived with you all year. 
Your friend’s child isn't your qualifying child and, 
because the child is your friend's qualifying 
child, your friend’s child isn't your qualifying rel-
ative (see Not a Qualifying Child Test in chap-
ter 3). As a result, your friend’s child isn't your 
qualifying person for head of household purpo-
ses.
Home of qualifying person. Generally, the 
qualifying person must live with you for more 
than half the year.
Special rule for parent. If your qualifying 
person is your parent, you may be eligible to file 
as head of household even if your parent 
doesn't live with you. However, you must be 
able to claim your parent as a dependent. Also, 
you must pay more than half of the cost of 
keeping up a home that was the main home for 
the entire year for your parent.
If you pay more than half of the cost of keep-
ing your parent in a rest home or home for the 
elderly, that counts as paying more than half of 
the cost of keeping up your parent's main 
home.
Death or birth. You may be eligible to file as 
head of household even if the individual who 
qualifies you for this filing status is born or dies 
during the year. If the individual is your qualify-
ing child, the child must have lived with you for 
more than half the part of the year the child was 
alive. If the individual is anyone else, see Pub. 
501 for more information.
Temporary absences. You and your quali-
fying person are considered to live together 
even if one or both of you are temporarily ab-
sent from your home due to special circumstan-
ces, such as illness, education, business, vaca-
tion, military service, or detention in a juvenile 
facility. It must be reasonable to assume the ab-
sent person will return to the home after the 
temporary absence. You must continue to keep 
up the home during the absence.
Kidnapped child. You may be eligible to file 
as head of household even if the child who is 
your qualifying person has been kidnapped. For 
more information, see Pub. 501.
Qualifying Surviving 
Spouse
If your spouse died in 2022, you can use mar-
ried filing jointly as your filing status for 2022 if 
you otherwise qualify to use that status. The 
year of death is the last year for which you can 
file jointly with your deceased spouse. See Mar-
ried Filing Jointly, earlier.
You may be eligible to use qualifying surviv-
ing spouse as your filing status for 2 years fol-
lowing the year your spouse died. For example, 
if your spouse died in 2021, and you haven't re-
married, you may be able to use this filing sta-
tus for 2022 and 2023.
This filing status entitles you to use joint re-
turn tax rates and the highest standard deduc-
tion amount (if you don’t itemize deductions). It 
doesn't entitle you to file a joint return.
How to file. Indicate your choice of this filing 
status by checking the “Qualifying surviving 
spouse” box on the Filing Status line at the top 
of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If the child who quali-
fies you for this filing status isn’t claimed as your 
dependent in the Dependents section of Form 
1040 or 1040-SR, enter the child’s name in the 
entry space at the bottom of the Filing Status 
section. Use the Married filing jointly column of 
the Tax Table, or Section B of the Tax Compu-
tation Worksheet, to figure your tax.
Eligibility rules. You are eligible to file your 
2022 return as a qualifying surviving spouse if 
you meet all of the following tests.
•
You were entitled to file a joint return with 
your spouse for the year your spouse died. 
It doesn't matter whether you actually filed 
a joint return.
•
Your spouse died in 2020 or 2021 and you 
didn't remarry before the end of 2022.
•
You have a child or stepchild (not a foster 
child) whom you can claim as a dependent 
or could claim as a dependent except that, 
for 2022:
 
a. The child had gross income of 
$4,400 or more,
 
b. The child filed a joint return, or
 
c. You could be claimed as a depend-
ent on someone else’s return.
If the child isn't claimed as your de-
pendent in the Dependents section on 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR, enter the child's 
name in the entry space at the bottom of 
the Filing Status section. If you don’t enter 
the name, it will take us longer to process 
your return.
•
This child lived in your home all year, ex-
cept for temporary absences. See Tempo-
rary absences, earlier, under Head of 
Household. There are also exceptions, de-
scribed later, for a child who was born or 
died during the year and for a kidnapped 
child.
•
You paid more than half of the cost of 
keeping up a home for the year. See Keep-
ing Up a Home, earlier, under Head of 
Household.
Example. A's spouse died in 2020. A hasn't 
remarried. During 2021 and 2022, A continued 
to keep up a home for A and A’s child, who lives 
with A and whom A can claim as a dependent. 
For 2020, A was entitled to file a joint return for 
A and A’s deceased spouse. For 2021 and 
2022, A can file as qualifying surviving spouse. 
After 2022, A can file as head of household if A 
qualifies.
Death or birth. You may be eligible to file as a 
qualifying surviving spouse if the child who 
qualifies you for this filing status is born or dies 
during the year. You must have provided more 
than half of the cost of keeping up a home that 
was the child's main home during the entire part 
of the year the child was alive.
Kidnapped child. You may be eligible to file 
as a qualifying surviving spouse even if the 
child who qualifies you for this filing status has 
been kidnapped. See Pub. 501 for more infor-
mation.
As mentioned earlier, this filing status 
is available for only 2 years following 
CAUTION the year your spouse died.

Dependents
The term “dependent” means:
•
A qualifying child, or
•
A qualifying relative.
The terms “qualifying child” and “qualifying 
relative” are defined later.
All the requirements for claiming a depend-
ent are summarized in Table 3-1.
Housekeepers, maids, or servants. If these 
people work for you, you can’t claim them as 
dependents.
Child tax credit. You may be entitled to a child 
tax credit for each qualifying child who was un-
der age 17 at the end of the year if you claimed 
that child as a dependent. For more informa-
tion, see chapter 14.
Who Is a Qualifying Person Qualifying You To File as Head of Household?1
Caution. See the text of this chapter for the other requirements you must meet to claim head of household 
filing status.
IF the person is your . . .
AND . . .
THEN that person is . . .
qualifying child (such as a son, 
daughter, or grandchild who lived with 
you more than half the year and meets 
certain other tests)2
the child is single
a qualifying person, whether or 
not the child meets the Citizen or 
Resident Test in chapter 3.
the child is married and you can claim the 
child as a dependent
a qualifying person.
the child is married and you can’t claim the 
child as a dependent
not a qualifying person.3
qualifying relative4 who is your father or 
mother
you can claim your parent as a dependent5
a qualifying person.6
you can’t claim your parent as a dependent
not a qualifying person.
qualifying relative4 other than your father 
or mother (such as a grandparent, 
brother, or sister who meets certain 
tests)
your relative lived with you more than half 
the year, and your relative is related to you 
in one of the ways listed under Relatives 
who don’t have to live with you in chapter 3 
and you can claim your relative as a 
dependent5
a qualifying person.
your relative didn't live with you more than 
half the year
not a qualifying person.
your relative isn't related to you in one of the 
ways listed under Relatives who don’t have 
to live with you in chapter 3 and is your 
qualifying relative only because your relative 
lived with you all year as a member of your 
household
not a qualifying person.
you can’t claim your relative as a dependent
not a qualifying person.
1 A person can’t qualify more than one taxpayer to use the head of household filing status for the year.
2 The term qualifying child is defined in chapter 3. Note. If you are a noncustodial parent, the term “qualifying child” for head of household filing status doesn't include a child who is your 
qualifying child only because of the rules described under Children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) under Qualifying Child in chapter 3. If you are the 
custodial parent and those rules apply, the child is generally your qualifying child for head of household filing status even though the child isn't a qualifying child you can claim as a 
dependent.
3 This person is a qualifying person if the only reason you can’t claim the person as a dependent is that you, or your spouse if filing jointly, can be claimed as a dependent on another 
taxpayer’s return.
4 The term qualifying relative is defined in chapter 3.
5 If you can claim a person as a dependent only because of a multiple support agreement, that person isn't a qualifying person. See Multiple Support Agreement in chapter 3.
6 See Special rule for parent under Qualifying Person, earlier.
Table 2-1.
Chapter 3 Dependents Page 25

Credit for other dependents. You may be en-
titled to a credit for other dependents for each 
qualifying child who does not qualify you for the 
child tax credit and for each qualifying relative. 
For more information, see chapter 14.
Exceptions
Even if you have a qualifying child or qualifying 
relative, you can claim that person as a depend-
ent only if these three tests are met.
1. Dependent taxpayer test.
2. Joint return test.
3. Citizen or resident test.
These three tests are explained in detail 
here.
Dependent Taxpayer Test
If you can be claimed as a dependent by an-
other taxpayer, you can’t claim anyone else as 
a dependent. Even if you have a qualifying child 
or qualifying relative, you can’t claim that per-
son as a dependent.
If you are filing a joint return and your 
spouse can be claimed as a dependent by an-
other taxpayer, you and your spouse can’t claim 
any dependents on your joint return.
Joint Return Test
You generally can’t claim a married person as a 
dependent if that person files a joint return.
Exception. You can claim a person as a de-
pendent who files a joint return if that person 
and that person’s spouse file the joint return 
only to claim a refund of income tax withheld or 
estimated tax paid.
Example 1—Child files joint return. You 
supported your 18-year-old child who lived with 
you all year while your child’s spouse was in the 
Armed Forces. Your child’s spouse earned 
$35,000 for the year. The couple files a joint re-
turn. You can’t claim your child as a dependent.
Overview of the Rules for Claiming a Dependent
Caution. This table is only an overview of the rules. For details, see the rest of this chapter.
• You can’t claim any dependents if you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) could be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer.
• You can’t claim a married person who files a joint return as a dependent unless that joint return is filed only to claim a refund of 
withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.
• You can’t claim a person as a dependent unless that person is a U.S. citizen, U.S. resident alien, U.S. national, or a resident of 
Canada or Mexico.1
• You can’t claim a person as a dependent unless that person is your qualifying child or qualifying relative.
Tests To Be a Qualifying Child
Tests To Be a Qualifying Relative
1. The child must be your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, 
brother, sister, half brother, half sister, stepbrother, stepsister, 
or a descendant of any of them.
2. The child must be (a) under age 19 at the end of the year and 
younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly); (b) under age 
24 at the end of the year, a student, and younger than you (or 
your spouse, if filing jointly); or (c) any age if permanently and 
totally disabled. 
3. The child must have lived with you for more than half of the 
year.2
4. The child must not have provided more than half of the child’s 
own support for the year.
5. The child must not be filing a joint return for the year (unless 
that return is filed only to get a refund of income tax withheld or 
estimated tax paid).
If the child meets the rules to be a qualifying child of more than one 
person, generally only one person can actually treat the child as a 
qualifying child. See Qualifying Child of More Than One Person, 
later, to find out which person is the person entitled to claim the 
child as a qualifying child.
1. The person can’t be your qualifying child or the 
qualifying child of any other taxpayer.
2. The person either (a) must be related to you in one of 
the ways listed under Relatives who don’t have to live 
with you, or (b) must live with you all year as a member 
of your household2 (and your relationship must not 
violate local law).
3. The person's gross income for the year must be less 
than $4,400.3
4. You must provide more than half of the person's total 
support for the year.4
1 There is an exception for certain adopted children.
2 There are exceptions for temporary absences, children who were born or died during the year, children of divorced or separated parents (or 
parents who live apart), and kidnapped children.
3 There is an exception if the person is disabled and has income from a sheltered workshop.
4 There are exceptions for multiple support agreements, children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart), and kidnapped 
children.

as claim for refund of withheld tax. Your 
18-year-old child and your child’s 17-year-old 
spouse had $800 of wages from part-time jobs 
and no other income. They lived with you all 
year. Neither is required to file a tax return. 
They don’t have a child. Taxes were taken out 
of their pay, so they filed a joint return only to 
get a refund of the withheld taxes. The excep-
tion to the joint return test applies, so you aren't 
disqualified from claiming each of them as a de-
pendent just because they file a joint return. 
You can claim each of them as a dependent if 
all the other tests to do so are met.
Example 3—Child files joint return to 
claim American opportunity credit. The 
facts are the same as in Example 2, except no 
taxes were taken out of your child’s pay or your 
child’s spouse’s pay. However, they file a joint 
return to claim an American opportunity credit 
of $124 and get a refund of that amount. Be-
cause claiming the American opportunity credit 
is their reason for filing the return, they aren't fil-
ing it only to get a refund of income tax withheld 
or estimated tax paid. The exception to the joint 
return test doesn't apply, so you can’t claim ei-
ther of them as a dependent.
Citizen or Resident Test
You generally can’t claim a person as a de-
pendent unless that person is a U.S. citizen, 
U.S. resident alien, U.S. national, or a resident 
of Canada or Mexico. However, there is an ex-
ception for certain adopted children, as ex-
plained next.
Exception for adopted child. If you are a 
U.S. citizen or U.S. national who has legally 
adopted a child who isn't a U.S. citizen, U.S. 
resident alien, or U.S. national, this test is met if 
the child lived with you as a member of your 
household all year. This exception also applies 
if the child was lawfully placed with you for legal 
adoption and the child lived with you for the rest 
of the year after placement.
Child's place of residence. Children are usu-
ally citizens or residents of the country of their 
parents.
If you were a U.S. citizen when your child 
was born, the child may be a U.S. citizen and 
meet this test even if the other parent was a 
nonresident alien and the child was born in a 
foreign country.
Foreign students' place of residence. For-
eign students brought to this country under a 
qualified international education exchange pro-
gram and placed in American homes for a tem-
porary period generally aren't U.S. residents 
and don’t meet this test. You can’t claim them 
as dependents. However, if you provided a 
home for a foreign student, you may be able to 
take a charitable contribution deduction. See 
Expenses Paid for Student Living With You in 
Pub. 526, Charitable Contributions.
U.S. national. A U.S. national is an individual 
who, although not a U.S. citizen, owes his or 
her allegiance to the United States. U.S. nation-
als include American Samoans and Northern 
Mariana Islanders who chose to become U.S. 
nationals instead of U.S. citizens.
Qualifying Child
Five tests must be met for a child to be your 
qualifying child. The five tests are:
1. Relationship,
2. Age,
3. Residency,
4. Support, and
5. Joint return.
These tests are explained next.
If a child meets the five tests to be the 
qualifying child of more than one per-
son, there are rules you must use to 
determine which person can actually treat the 
child as a qualifying child. See Qualifying Child 
of More Than One Person, later.
Relationship Test
To meet this test, a child must be:
•
Your son, daughter, stepchild, or foster 
child, or a descendant (for example, your 
grandchild) of any of them; or
•
Your brother, sister, half brother, half sis-
ter, stepbrother, or stepsister, or a de-
scendant (for example, your niece or 
nephew) of any of them.
Adopted child. An adopted child is always 
treated as your own child. The term “adopted 
child” includes a child who was lawfully placed 
with you for legal adoption.
Foster child. A foster child is an individual who 
is placed with you by an authorized placement 
agency or by judgment, decree, or other order 
of any court of competent jurisdiction.
Age Test
To meet this test, a child must be:
•
Under age 19 at the end of the year and 
younger than you (or your spouse if filing 
jointly);
•
A student under age 24 at the end of the 
year and younger than you (or your spouse 
if filing jointly); or
•
Permanently and totally disabled at any 
time during the year, regardless of age.
Example. Your child turned 19 on Decem-
ber 10. Unless this child was permanently and 
totally disabled or a student, this child doesn't 
meet the age test because, at the end of the 
year, this child wasn't under age 19.
Child must be younger than you or spouse. 
To be your qualifying child, a child who isn't per-
manently and totally disabled must be younger 
than you. However, if you are married filing 
jointly, the child must be younger than you or 
your spouse but doesn't have to be younger 
than both of you.
Example 1—Child not younger than you 
or spouse. Your 23-year-old sibling, who is a 
student and unmarried, lives with you and your 
spouse, who provide more than half of your sib-
ling’s support. Your sibling isn't disabled. Both 
you and your spouse are 21 years old, and you 
CAUTION
!
file a joint return. Your sibling isn't your qualify-
ing child because your sibling isn't younger than 
you or your spouse.
Example 2—Child younger than your 
spouse but not younger than you. The facts 
are the same as in Example 1, except your 
spouse is 25 years old. Because your sibling is 
younger than your spouse, and you and your 
spouse are filing a joint return, your sibling is 
your qualifying child, even though your sibling 
isn't younger than you.
Student defined. To qualify as a student, your 
child must be, during some part of each of any 5 
calendar months of the year:
1. A full-time student at a school that has a 
regular teaching staff and course of study, 
and a regularly enrolled student body at 
the school; or
2. A student taking a full-time, on-farm train-
ing course given by a school described in 
(1), or by a state, county, or local govern-
ment agency.
The 5 calendar months don’t have to be con-
secutive.
Full-time student. A full-time student is a 
student who is enrolled for the number of hours 
or courses the school considers to be full-time 
attendance.
School defined. A school can be an ele-
mentary school; a junior or senior high school; a 
college; a university; or a technical, trade, or 
mechanical school. However, an on-the-job 
training course, correspondence school, or 
school offering courses only through the Inter-
net doesn’t count as a school.
Vocational high school students. Stu-
dents who work on “co-op” jobs in private indus-
try as a part of a school's regular course of 
classroom and practical training are considered 
full-time students.
Permanently and totally disabled. Your child 
is permanently and totally disabled if both of the 
following apply.
•
Your child can’t engage in any substantial 
gainful activity because of a physical or 
mental condition.
•
A doctor determines the condition has las-
ted or can be expected to last continuously 
for at least a year or can lead to death.
Residency Test
To meet this test, your child must have lived 
with you for more than half the year. There are 
exceptions for temporary absences, children 
who were born or died during the year, kidnap-
ped children, and children of divorced or sepa-
rated parents.
Temporary absences. Your child is consid-
ered to have lived with you during periods of 
time when one of you, or both, is temporarily 
absent due to special circumstances such as:
•
Illness,
•
Education,
•
Business,
•
Vacation,
Chapter 3 Dependents Page 27

•
Military service, or
•
Detention in a juvenile facility.
Death or birth of child. A child who was born 
or died during the year is treated as having lived 
with you more than half of the year if your home 
was the child's home more than half of the time 
the child was alive during the year. The same is 
true if the child lived with you more than half the 
year except for any required hospital stay fol-
lowing birth.
Child born alive. You may be able to claim 
as a dependent a child born alive during the 
year, even if the child lived only for a moment. 
State or local law must treat the child as having 
been born alive. There must be proof of a live 
birth shown by an official document, such as a 
birth certificate. The child must be your qualify-
ing child or qualifying relative, and all the other 
tests to claim the child as a dependent must be 
met.
Stillborn child. You can’t claim a stillborn 
child as a dependent.
Kidnapped child. You may be able to treat 
your child as meeting the residency test even if 
the child has been kidnapped. See Pub. 501 for 
details.
Children of divorced or separated parents 
(or parents who live apart). In most cases, 
because of the residency test, a child of di-
vorced or separated parents is the qualifying 
child of the custodial parent. However, the child 
will be treated as the qualifying child of the non-
custodial parent if all four of the following state-
ments are true.
1. The parents:
a. Are divorced or legally separated un-
der a decree of divorce or separate 
maintenance;
b. Are separated under a written separa-
tion agreement; or
c. Lived apart at all times during the last 
6 months of the year, whether or not 
they are or were married.
2. The child received over half of the child’s 
support for the year from the parents.
3. The child is in the custody of one or both 
parents for more than half of the year.
4. Either of the following statements is true.
a. The custodial parent signs a written 
declaration, discussed later, that they 
won't claim the child as a dependent 
for the year, and the noncustodial pa-
rent attaches this written declaration 
to their return. (If the decree or agree-
ment went into effect after 1984 and 
before 2009, see Post-1984 and 
pre-2009 divorce decree or separa-
tion agreement, later. If the decree or 
agreement went into effect after 2008, 
see Post-2008 divorce decree or sep-
aration agreement, later.)
b. A pre-1985 decree of divorce or sepa-
rate maintenance or written separa-
tion agreement that applies to 2022 
states that the noncustodial parent 
can claim the child as a dependent, 
the decree or agreement wasn't 
changed after 1984 to say the non-
custodial parent can’t claim the child 
as a dependent, and the noncustodial 
parent provides at least $600 for the 
child's support during the year.
If statements (1) through (4) are all true, only 
the noncustodial parent can:
•
Claim the child as a dependent; and
•
Claim the child as a qualifying child for the 
child tax credit or credit for other depend-
ents.
However, this doesn’t allow the noncustodial 
parent to claim head of household filing status, 
the credit for child and dependent care expen-
ses, the exclusion for dependent care benefits, 
or the earned income credit. See Applying the 
tiebreaker rules to divorced or separated pa-
rents (or parents who live apart), later.
Example—Earned income credit. Even if 
statements (1) through (4) are all true and the 
custodial parent signs Form 8332 or a substan-
tially similar statement that the custodial parent 
won’t claim the child as a dependent for 2022, 
this doesn’t allow the noncustodial parent to 
claim the child as a qualifying child for the 
earned income credit. The custodial parent or 
another taxpayer, if eligible, can claim the child 
for the earned income credit.
Custodial parent and noncustodial pa-
rent. The custodial parent is the parent with 
whom the child lived for the greater number of 
nights during the year. The other parent is the 
noncustodial parent.
If the parents divorced or separated during 
the year and the child lived with both parents 
before the separation, the custodial parent is 
the one with whom the child lived for the greater 
number of nights during the rest of the year.
A child is treated as living with a parent for a 
night if the child sleeps:
•
At that parent's home, whether or not the 
parent is present; or
•
In the company of the parent, when the 
child doesn't sleep at a parent's home (for 
example, the parent and child are on vaca-
tion together).
Equal number of nights. If the child lived 
with each parent for an equal number of nights 
during the year, the custodial parent is the pa-
rent with the higher AGI.
December 31. The night of December 31 is 
treated as part of the year in which it begins. For 
example, the night of December 31, 2022, is 
treated as part of 2022.
Emancipated child. If a child is emancipa-
ted under state law, the child is treated as not 
living with either parent. See Examples 5 and 6.
Absences. If a child wasn't with either pa-
rent on a particular night (because, for example, 
the child was staying at a friend's house), the 
child is treated as living with the parent with 
whom the child normally would have lived for 
that night, except for the absence. But if it can’t 
be determined with which parent the child nor-
mally would have lived or if the child wouldn’t 
have lived with either parent that night, the child 
is treated as not living with either parent that 
night.
Parent works at night. If, due to a parent's 
nighttime work schedule, a child lives for a 
greater number of days, but not nights, with the 
parent who works at night, that parent is treated 
as the custodial parent. On a school day, the 
child is treated as living at the primary resi-
dence registered with the school.
Example 1—Child lived with one parent 
for a greater number of nights. You and your 
child’s other parent are divorced. In 2022, your 
child lived with you 210 nights and with the 
other parent 155 nights. You are the custodial 
parent.
Example 2—Child is away at camp. In 
2022, your child lives with each parent for alter-
nate weeks. In the summer, your child spends 6 
weeks at summer camp. During those 6 weeks, 
your child is treated as living with you for 3 
weeks and with your child’s other parent, your 
ex-spouse, for 3 weeks because this is how 
long the child would have lived with each parent 
if the child had not attended summer camp.
Example 3—Child lived same number of 
nights with each parent. Your child lived with 
you 180 nights during the year and lived the 
same number of nights with the child’s other pa-
rent, your ex-spouse. Your AGI is $40,000. Your 
ex-spouse's AGI is $25,000. You are treated as 
your child's custodial parent because you have 
the higher AGI.
Example 4—Child is at parent’s home 
but with other parent. Your child normally 
lives with you during the week and with the 
child’s other parent, your ex-spouse, every 
other weekend. You become ill and are hospi-
talized. The other parent lives in your home with 
your child for 10 consecutive days while you are 
in the hospital. Your child is treated as living 
with you during this 10-day period because your 
child was living in your home.
Example 5—Child emancipated in May. 
Your child turned 18 in May 2022 and became 
emancipated under the law of the state where 
your child lives. As a result, your child isn't con-
sidered in the custody of either parent for more 
than half of the year. The special rule for chil-
dren of divorced or separated parents doesn't 
apply.
Example 6—Child emancipated in Au-
gust. Your child lives with you from January 1, 
2022, until May 31, 2022, and lives with the 
child’s other parent, your ex-spouse, from June 
1, 2022, through the end of the year. Your child 
turns 18 and is emancipated under state law on 
August 1, 2022. Because your child is treated 
as not living with either parent beginning on Au-
gust 1, your child is treated as living with you 
the greater number of nights in 2022. You are 
the custodial parent.
Written declaration. The custodial parent 
must use either Form 8332 or a similar state-
ment (containing the same information required 
by the form) to make the written declaration to 
release a claim to an exemption for a child to 
the noncustodial parent. Although the exemp-
tion amount is zero for tax year 2022, this re-
lease allows the noncustodial parent to claim 
the child tax credit, additional child tax credit, 
Page 28 Chapter 3 Dependents

and credit for other dependents, if applicable, 
for the child. The noncustodial parent must at-
tach a copy of the form or statement to their tax 
return.
The release can be for 1 year, for a number 
of specified years (for example, alternate 
years), or for all future years, as specified in the 
declaration.
Post-1984 and pre-2009 divorce decree 
or separation agreement. If the divorce de-
cree or separation agreement went into effect 
after 1984 and before 2009, the noncustodial 
parent may be able to attach certain pages from 
the decree or agreement instead of Form 8332. 
The decree or agreement must state all three of 
the following.
1. The noncustodial parent can claim the 
child as a dependent without regard to any 
condition, such as payment of support.
2. The custodial parent won't claim the child 
as a dependent for the year.
3. The years for which the noncustodial pa-
rent, rather than the custodial parent, can 
claim the child as a dependent.
The noncustodial parent must attach all of 
the following pages of the decree or agreement 
to their tax return.
•
The cover page (write the other parent's 
SSN on this page).
•
The pages that include all of the informa-
tion identified in items (1) through (3) 
above.
•
The signature page with the other parent's 
signature and the date of the agreement.
Post-2008 divorce decree or separation 
agreement. The noncustodial parent can’t at-
tach pages from the decree or agreement in-
stead of Form 8332 if the decree or agreement 
went into effect after 2008. The custodial parent 
must sign either Form 8332 or a similar state-
ment whose only purpose is to release the cus-
todial parent's claim to an exemption for a child, 
and the noncustodial parent must attach a copy 
to their return. The form or statement must re-
lease the custodial parent's claim to the child 
without any conditions. For example, the re-
lease must not depend on the noncustodial pa-
rent paying support.
The noncustodial parent must attach 
the required information even if it was 
filed with a return in an earlier year.
Revocation of release of claim to an ex-
emption. The custodial parent can revoke a 
release of claim to an exemption. For the revo-
cation to be effective for 2022, the custodial pa-
rent must have given (or made reasonable ef-
forts to give) written notice of the revocation to 
the noncustodial parent in 2021 or earlier. The 
custodial parent can use Part III of Form 8332 
for this purpose and must attach a copy of the 
revocation to their return for each tax year the 
custodial parent claims the child as a depend-
ent as a result of the revocation.
Remarried parent. If you remarry, the sup-
port provided by your new spouse is treated as 
provided by you.
CAUTION
!
Parents who never married. This special 
rule for divorced or separated parents also ap-
plies to parents who never married and who 
lived apart at all times during the last 6 months 
of the year.
Support Test (To Be a Qualifying 
Child)
To meet this test, the child can’t have provided 
more than half of the child’s own support for the 
year.
This test is different from the support test to 
be a qualifying relative, which is described later. 
However, to see what is or isn't support, see 
Support Test (To Be a Qualifying Relative), 
later. If you aren't sure whether a child provided 
more than half of their own support, you may 
find Worksheet 3-1 helpful.
Example. You provided $4,000 toward 
your 16-year-old child's support for the year and 
the child provided $6,000. Your child provided 
more than half their own support. The child isn't 
your qualifying child.
Foster care payments and expenses. Pay-
ments you receive for the support of a foster 
child from a child placement agency are consid-
ered support provided by the agency. Similarly, 
payments you receive for the support of a foster 
child from a state or county are considered sup-
port provided by the state or county.
If you aren't in the trade or business of pro-
viding foster care and your unreimbursed 
out-of-pocket expenses in caring for a foster 
child were mainly to benefit an organization 
qualified to receive deductible charitable contri-
butions, the expenses are deductible as chari-
table contributions but aren't considered sup-
port you provided. For more information about 
the deduction for charitable contributions, see 
Pub. 526. If your unreimbursed expenses aren't 
deductible as charitable contributions, they may 
qualify as support you provided.
If you are in the trade or business of provid-
ing foster care, your unreimbursed expenses 
aren't considered support provided by you.
Example 1. L, a foster child, lived with mar-
ried couple, A and B Smith for the last 3 months 
of the year. The Smiths cared for L because 
they wanted to adopt L (although L hadn’t been 
placed with them for adoption). They didn't care 
for L as a trade or business or to benefit the 
agency that placed L in their home. The Smiths' 
unreimbursed expenses aren't deductible as 
charitable contributions but are considered sup-
port they provided for L.
Example 2. You provided $3,000 toward 
your 10-year-old foster child's support for the 
year. The state government provided $4,000, 
which is considered support provided by the 
state, not by the child. See Support provided by 
the state (welfare, food stamps, housing, etc.), 
later. Your foster child didn't provide more than 
half of their own support for the year.
Scholarships. A scholarship received by a 
child who is a student isn't taken into account in 
determining whether the child provided more 
than half of their own support.
Joint Return Test (To Be a 
Qualifying Child)
To meet this test, the child can’t file a joint re-
turn for the year.
Exception. An exception to the joint return test 
applies if your child and the child’s spouse file a 
joint return only to claim a refund of income tax 
withheld or estimated tax paid.
Example 1—Child files joint return. You 
supported your 18-year-old child who lived with 
you all year while your child’s spouse was in the 
Armed Forces. Your child’s spouse earned 
$35,000 for the year. The couple files a joint re-
turn so this child isn't your qualifying child.
Example 2—Child files joint return only 
as a claim for refund of withheld tax. Your 
18-year-old child and your child’s 17-year-old 
spouse had $800 of wages from part-time jobs 
and no other income. They lived with you all 
year. Neither is required to file a tax return. 
They don’t have a child. Taxes were taken out 
of their pay so they filed a joint return only to get 
a refund of the withheld taxes. The exception to 
the joint return test applies, so this child may be 
your qualifying child if all the other tests are 
met.
Example 3—Child files joint return to 
claim American opportunity credit. The 
facts are the same as in Example 2, except no 
taxes were taken out of either spouse’s pay. 
However, they file a joint return to claim an 
American opportunity credit of $124 and get a 
refund of that amount. Because claiming the 
American opportunity credit is their reason for 
filing the return, they aren't filing it only to get a 
refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax 
paid. The exception to the joint return test 
doesn't apply, so this child isn't your qualifying 
child.
Qualifying Child of More Than One 
Person
If your qualifying child isn't a qualifying 
child of anyone else, this topic doesn't 
apply to you and you don’t need to 
read about it. This is also true if your qualifying 
child isn't a qualifying child of anyone else ex-
cept your spouse with whom you plan to file a 
joint return.
If a child is treated as the qualifying 
child of the noncustodial parent under 
the rules for children of divorced or 
separated parents (or parents who live apart) 
described earlier, see Applying the tiebreaker 
rules to divorced or separated parents (or pa-
rents who live apart), later.
Sometimes, a child meets the relationship, 
age, residency, support, and joint return tests to 
be a qualifying child of more than one person. 
Although the child is a qualifying child of each of 
these persons, generally only one person can 
actually treat the child as a qualifying child to 
take all of the following tax benefits (provided 
the person is eligible for each benefit).
1. The child tax credit, credit for other de-
pendents, or additional child tax credit.

dependent unless you can do so under a multiple support agreement, the support test for children of divorced or 
separated parents, or the special rule for kidnapped children. See Multiple Support Agreement or Support Test for 
Children of Divorced or Separated Parents (or Parents Who Live Apart), or Kidnapped child under Qualifying Relative.

2. Head of household filing status.
3. The credit for child and dependent care 
expenses.
4. The exclusion from income for dependent 
care benefits.
5. The earned income credit.
The other person can’t take any of these 
benefits based on this qualifying child. In other 
words, you and the other person can’t agree to 
divide these benefits between you.
Tiebreaker rules. To determine which person 
can treat the child as a qualifying child to claim 
these five tax benefits, the following tiebreaker 
rules apply.
•
If only one of the persons is the child's pa-
rent, the child is treated as the qualifying 
child of the parent.
•
If the parents file a joint return together and 
can claim the child as a qualifying child, 
the child is treated as the qualifying child of 
the parents.
•
If the parents don’t file a joint return to-
gether but both parents claim the child as a 
qualifying child, the IRS will treat the child 
as the qualifying child of the parent with 
whom the child lived for the longer period 
of time during the year. If the child lived 
with each parent for the same amount of 
time, the IRS will treat the child as the qual-
ifying child of the parent who had the 
higher AGI for the year.
•
If no parent can claim the child as a quali-
fying child, the child is treated as the quali-
fying child of the person who had the high-
est AGI for the year.
•
If a parent can claim the child as a qualify-
ing child but no parent does so claim the 
child, the child is treated as the qualifying 
child of the person who had the highest 
AGI for the year, but only if that person's 
AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any of 
the child's parents who can claim the child.
Subject to these tiebreaker rules, you and 
the other person may be able to choose which 
of you claims the child as a qualifying child.
You may be able to qualify for the 
earned income credit under the rules 
for taxpayers without a qualifying child 
if you have a qualifying child for the earned in-
come credit who is claimed as a qualifying child 
by another taxpayer. For more information, see 
Pub. 596.
Example 1—Child lived with parent and 
grandparent. You and your 3-year-old child J 
lived with your parent all year. You are 25 years 
old and unmarried, and your AGI is $9,000. 
Your parent's AGI is $15,000. Your child’s other 
parent didn't live with you or your child. You 
haven't signed Form 8332 (or a similar state-
ment).
J is a qualifying child of both you and your 
parent because J meets the relationship, age, 
residency, support, and joint return tests for 
both you and your parent. However, only one of 
you can claim J. J isn't a qualifying child of any-
one else, including J’s other parent. You agree 
to let your parent claim J. This means your 
TIP
parent can claim J as a qualifying child for all of 
the five tax benefits listed earlier, if your parent 
qualifies for each of those benefits (and if you 
don’t claim J as a qualifying child for any of 
those tax benefits).
Example 2—Parent has higher AGI than 
grandparent. The facts are the same as in Ex-
ample 1, except your AGI is $18,000. Because 
your parent's AGI isn't higher than yours, your 
parent can’t claim J. Only you can claim J.
Example 3—Two persons claim same 
child. The facts are the same as in Example 1, 
except you and your parent both claim J as a 
qualifying child. In this case, you, as the child's 
parent, will be the only one allowed to claim J 
as a qualifying child. The IRS will disallow your 
parent's claim to the five tax benefits listed ear-
lier based on J. However, your parent may qual-
ify for the earned income credit as a taxpayer 
without a qualifying child.
Example 4—Qualifying children split be-
tween two persons. The facts are the same 
as in Example 1, except you also have two 
other young children who are qualifying children 
of both you and your parent. Only one of you 
can claim each child. However, if your parent's 
AGI is higher than yours, you can allow your pa-
rent to claim one or more of the children. For 
example, if you claim one child, your parent can 
claim the other two.
Example 5—Taxpayer who is a qualify-
ing child. The facts are the same as in Exam-
ple 1, except you are only 18 years old and 
didn't provide more than half of your own sup-
port for the year. This means you are your pa-
rent's qualifying child. If your parent can claim 
you as a dependent, then you can’t claim your 
child as a dependent because of the Depend-
ent Taxpayer Test, explained earlier.
Example 
6—Separated 
parents. You, 
your spouse, and your 10-year-old child lived 
together until August 1, 2022, when your 
spouse moved out of the household. In August 
and September, your child lived with you. For 
the rest of the year, your child lived with your 
spouse, the child's parent. Your child is a quali-
fying child of both you and your spouse be-
cause your child lived with each of you for more 
than half the year and because your child met 
the relationship, age, support, and joint return 
tests for both of you. At the end of the year, you 
and your spouse still weren't divorced, legally 
separated, or separated under a written separa-
tion agreement, so the rule for children of di-
vorced or separated parents (or parents who 
live apart) doesn't apply.
You and your spouse will file separate re-
turns. Your spouse agrees to let you treat your 
child as a qualifying child. This means, if your 
spouse doesn't claim your child as a qualifying 
child, you can claim this child as a qualifying 
child for the child tax credit and exclusion for 
dependent care benefits (if you qualify for each 
of those tax benefits). However, you can’t claim 
head of household filing status because you 
and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 
months of the year. As a result, your filing status 
is married filing separately, so you can’t claim 
the earned income credit because you and your 
spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 
2022, and you aren't legally separated under a 
written separation agreement or decree of sep-
arate maintenance. Therefore, you don't meet 
the requirements to take the earned income 
credit as married filing separately. You also 
can't take the credit for child and dependent 
care expenses because your filing status is 
married filing separately and you and your 
spouse didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 
2022.
Example 7—Separated parents claim 
same child.  The facts are the same as in Ex-
ample 6, except you and your spouse both 
claim your child as a qualifying child. In this 
case, only your spouse will be allowed to treat 
your child as a qualifying child. This is because, 
during 2022, the child lived with your spouse 
longer than with you. If you claimed the child tax 
credit for your child, the IRS will disallow your 
claim to the child tax credit. If you don’t have 
another qualifying child or dependent, the IRS 
will also disallow your claim to the exclusion for 
dependent care benefits. In addition, because 
you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 
6 months of the year, your spouse can’t claim 
head of household filing status. As a result, your 
spouse’s filing status is married filing sepa-
rately, so your spouse can’t claim the earned in-
come credit because you and your spouse 
didn't live apart for the last 6 months of 2022, 
and you aren't legally separated under a written 
separation agreement or decree of separate 
maintenance. Therefore, your spouse doesn't 
meet the requirements to take the earned in-
come credit as married filing separately. Your 
spouse also can't take the credit for child and 
dependent care expenses because your spou-
se’s filing status is married filing separately and 
you and your spouse didn't live apart for the last 
6 months of 2022.
Example 
8—Unmarried 
parents. You, 
your 5-year-old child, L, and L’s other parent 
lived together all year. You and L’s other parent 
aren't married. L is a qualifying child of both you 
and L’s other parent because L meets the rela-
tionship, age, residency, support, and joint re-
turn tests for both you and L’s other parent. 
Your AGI is $12,000 and L’s other parent’s AGI 
is $14,000. L’s other parent agrees to let you 
claim the child as a qualifying child. This means 
you can claim L as a qualifying child for the 
child tax credit, head of household filing status, 
the credit for child and dependent care expen-
ses, the exclusion for dependent care benefits, 
and the earned income credit, if you qualify for 
each of those tax benefits (and if L’s other pa-
rent doesn't claim L as a qualifying child for any 
of those tax benefits).
Example 9—Unmarried parents claim 
same child. The facts are the same as in Ex-
ample 8, except you and L’s other parent both 
claim L as a qualifying child. In this case, only 
L’s other parent will be allowed to treat L as a 
qualifying child. This is because L’s other pa-
rent’s AGI, $14,000, is more than your AGI, 
$12,000. If you claimed the child tax credit for L, 
the IRS will disallow your claim to this credit. If 
you don’t have another qualifying child or de-
pendent, the IRS will also disallow your claim to 
head of household filing status, the credit for 
Chapter 3 Dependents Page 31

child and dependent care expenses, and the 
exclusion for dependent care benefits. How-
ever, you may be able to claim the earned in-
come credit as a taxpayer without a qualifying 
child.
Example 10—Child didn't live with a pa-
rent. You and your sibling’s child, M, lived with 
your parent all year. You are 25 years old, and 
your AGI is $9,300. Your parent’s AGI is 
$15,000. M’s parents file jointly, have an AGI of 
less than $9,000, and don’t live with you or M. 
M is a qualifying child of both you and your pa-
rent because M meets the relationship, age, 
residency, support, and joint return tests for 
both you and your parent. However, only your 
parent can treat M as a qualifying child. This is 
because your parent’s AGI, $15,000, is more 
than your AGI, $9,300.
Applying the tiebreaker rules to divorced or 
separated parents (or parents who live 
apart). If a child is treated as the qualifying 
child of the noncustodial parent under the rules 
described earlier for children of divorced or sep-
arated parents (or parents who live apart), only 
the noncustodial parent can claim the child as a 
dependent and claim the child tax credit or 
credit for other dependents for the child. How-
ever, only the custodial parent can claim the 
credit for child and dependent care expenses or 
the exclusion for dependent care benefits for 
the child. Also, generally, the noncustodial pa-
rent can't claim the child as a qualifying child for 
head of household filing status or the earned in-
come credit. Instead, generally, the custodial 
parent, if eligible, or other eligible person can 
claim the child as a qualifying child for those 
two benefits. If the child is the qualifying child of 
more than one person for these benefits, then 
the tiebreaker rules just explained determine 
whether the custodial parent or another eligible 
person can treat the child as a qualifying child.
Example 1. You and your 5-year-old child, 
E, lived all year with your parent, who paid the 
entire cost of keeping up the home. Your AGI is 
$10,000. Your parent's AGI is $25,000. E’s 
other parent didn’t live with you or E.
Under the rules explained earlier for children 
of divorced or separated parents (or parents 
who live apart), E is treated as the qualifying 
child of E’s other parent, who can claim the 
child tax credit for E. Because of this, you can’t 
claim the child tax credit for E. However, those 
rules don't allow E’s other parent to claim E as a 
qualifying child for head of household filing sta-
tus, the credit for child and dependent care ex-
penses, the exclusion for dependent care bene-
fits, or the earned income credit.
You and your parent didn't have any child 
care expenses or dependent care benefits, so 
neither of you can claim the credit for child and 
dependent care expenses or the exclusion for 
dependent care benefits. But E is a qualifying 
child of both you and your parent for head of 
household filing status and the earned income 
credit because E meets the relationship, age, 
residency, support, and joint return tests for 
both you and your parent. (The support test 
doesn't apply for the earned income credit.) 
However, you agree to let your parent claim E. 
This means your parent can claim E for head of 
household filing status and the earned income 
credit if your parent qualifies for each and if you 
don’t claim E as a qualifying child for the earned 
income credit. (You can’t claim head of house-
hold filing status because your parent paid the 
entire cost of keeping up the home.) You may 
be able to claim the earned income credit as a 
taxpayer without a qualifying child.
Example 2. The facts are the same as in 
Example 1, except your AGI is $25,000 and 
your parent's AGI is $21,000. Your parent can’t 
claim E as a qualifying child for any purpose be-
cause your parent’s AGI isn't higher than yours.
Example 3. The facts are the same as in 
Example 1, except you and your parent both 
claim E as a qualifying child for the earned in-
come credit. Your parent also claims E as a 
qualifying child for head of household filing sta-
tus. You, as the child's parent, will be the only 
one allowed to claim E as a qualifying child for 
the earned income credit. The IRS will disallow 
your parent's claim to head of household filing 
status unless your parent has another qualifying 
child or dependent. Your parent can't claim the 
earned income credit as a taxpayer without a 
qualifying child because your parent’s AGI is 
more than $16,480.
Qualifying Relative
Four tests must be met for a person to be your 
qualifying relative. The four tests are:
1. Not a qualifying child test,
2. Member of household or relationship test,
3. Gross income test, and
4. Support test.
Age. Unlike a qualifying child, a qualifying rela-
tive can be any age. There is no age test for a 
qualifying relative.
Kidnapped child. You may be able to treat a 
child as your qualifying relative even if the child 
has been kidnapped. See Pub. 501 for details.
Not a Qualifying Child Test
A child isn't your qualifying relative if the child is 
your qualifying child or the qualifying child of 
any other taxpayer.
Example 1. Your 22-year-old child, who is 
a student, lives with you and meets all the tests 
to be your qualifying child. This child isn't your 
qualifying relative.
Example 2. Your 2-year-old child lives with 
your parents and meets all the tests to be their 
qualifying child. This child isn't your qualifying 
relative.
Example 3. Your 30-year old child lives 
with you. This child isn’t a qualifying child be-
cause the age test isn’t met. This child may be 
your qualifying relative if the gross income test 
and the support test are met.
Example 4. Your 13-year-old grandchild 
only lived with you for 5 months during the year. 
Your grandchild isn’t your qualifying child be-
cause the residency test isn’t met. Your grand-
child may be your qualifying relative if the gross 
income test and the support test are met.
Child of person not required to file a return. 
A child isn't the qualifying child of any other tax-
payer and so may qualify as your qualifying rel-
ative if the child's parent (or other person for 
whom the child is defined as a qualifying child) 
isn't required to file an income tax return and ei-
ther:
•
Doesn't file an income tax return, or
•
Files a return only to get a refund of in-
come tax withheld or estimated tax paid.
Example 1—Return not required. You 
support an unrelated friend and your friend’s 
3-year-old child, who lived with you all year in 
your home. Your friend has no gross income, 
isn't required to file a 2022 tax return, and 
doesn't file a 2022 tax return. Both your friend 
and your friend’s child are your qualifying rela-
tives if the support test is met.
Example 2—Return filed to claim refund. 
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except 
your friend had wages of $1,500 during the year 
and had income tax withheld from your friend’s 
wages. Your friend files a return only to get a re-
fund of the income tax withheld and doesn't 
claim the earned income credit or any other tax 
credits or deductions. Both your friend and your 
friend’s child are your qualifying relatives if the 
support test is met.
Example 
3—Earned 
income 
credit 
claimed. The facts are the same as in Exam-
ple 2, except your friend had wages of $8,000 
during the year and claimed the earned income 
credit. Your friend's child is the qualifying child 
of another taxpayer (your friend), so you can’t 
claim your friend's child as your qualifying rela-
tive. Also, you can’t claim your friend as your 
qualifying relative because of the gross income 
test explained later.
Child in Canada or Mexico. You may be able 
to claim your child as a dependent even if the 
child lives in Canada or Mexico. If the child 
doesn't live with you, the child doesn't meet the 
residency test to be your qualifying child. How-
ever, the child may still be your qualifying rela-
tive. If the persons the child does live with aren't 
U.S. citizens and have no U.S. gross income, 
those persons aren't “taxpayers,” so the child 
isn't the qualifying child of any other taxpayer. If 
the child isn't the qualifying child of any other 
taxpayer, the child is your qualifying relative as 
long as the gross income test and the support 
test are met.
You can’t claim as a dependent a child who 
lives in a foreign country other than Canada or 
Mexico, unless the child is a U.S. citizen, U.S. 
resident alien, or U.S. national. There is an ex-
ception for certain adopted children who lived 
with you all year. See Citizen or Resident Test, 
earlier.
Example. You provide all the support of 
your children, ages 6, 8, and 12, who live in 
Mexico with your parent and have no income. 
You are single and live in the United States. 
Your parent isn't a U.S. citizen and has no U.S. 
income, so your parent isn't a “taxpayer.” Your 
children aren't your qualifying children because 
they don’t meet the residency test. But since 
they aren't the qualifying children of any other 
taxpayer, they may be your qualifying relatives 
Page 32 Chapter 3 Dependents

and you may be permitted to claim them as de-
pendents. You may also be able to claim your 
parent as a dependent if the gross income and 
support tests are met.
Member of Household or 
Relationship Test
To meet this test, a person must either:
1. Live with you all year as a member of your 
household, or
2. Be related to you in one of the ways listed 
under Relatives who don’t have to live with 
you below.
If at any time during the year the person was 
your spouse, that person can’t be your qualify-
ing relative.
Relatives who don’t have to live with you. A 
person related to you in any of the following 
ways doesn't have to live with you all year as a 
member of your household to meet this test.
•
Your child, stepchild, or foster child, or a 
descendant of any of them (for example, 
your grandchild). (A legally adopted child 
is considered your child.)
•
Your brother, sister, half brother, half sis-
ter, stepbrother, or stepsister.
•
Your father, mother, grandparent, or other 
direct ancestor, but not foster parent.
•
Your stepfather or stepmother.
•
A son or daughter of your brother or sister.
•
A son or daughter of your half brother or 
half sister.
•
A brother or sister of your father or mother.
•
Your son-in-law, daughter-in-law, fa-
ther-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, 
or sister-in-law.
Any of these relationships that were established 
by marriage aren't ended by death or divorce.
Example. In 2016, you and your spouse 
began supporting your spouse’s unmarried pa-
rent, G. Your spouse died in 2021. Despite your 
spouse’s death, G continues to meet this test, 
even if G doesn’t live with you. You can claim G 
as a dependent if all other tests are met, includ-
ing the gross income and support tests.
Foster child. A foster child is an individual 
who is placed with you by an authorized place-
ment agency or by judgment, decree, or other 
order of any court of competent jurisdiction.
Joint return. If you file a joint return, the per-
son can be related to either you or your spouse. 
Also, the person doesn't need to be related to 
the spouse who provides support.
For example, you provide more than half the 
support for your spouse’s stepparent. Your 
spouse’s stepparent may be your qualifying rel-
ative even if the stepparent doesn't live with 
you. However, if you and your spouse file sepa-
rate returns, your spouse's stepparent can be 
your qualifying relative only if the stepparent 
lives with you all year as a member of your 
household.
Temporary absences. A person is considered 
to live with you as a member of your household 
during periods of time when one of you, or both, 
is temporarily absent due to special circumstan-
ces such as:
•
Illness,
•
Education,
•
Business,
•
Vacation,
•
Military service, or
•
Detention in a juvenile facility.
If the person is placed in a nursing home for 
an indefinite period of time to receive constant 
medical care, the absence may be considered 
temporary.
Death or birth. A person who died during the 
year, but lived with you as a member of your 
household until death, will meet this test. The 
same is true for a child who was born during the 
year and lived with you as a member of your 
household for the rest of the year. The test is 
also met if a child lived with you as a member of 
your household except for any required hospital 
stay following birth.
If your dependent died during the year and 
you otherwise qualify to claim that person as a 
dependent, you can still claim that person as a 
dependent.
Example. Your parent, who met the tests to 
be your qualifying relative, died on January 15. 
You can claim your parent as a dependent on 
your return.
Local law violated. A person doesn't meet 
this test if at any time during the year the rela-
tionship between you and that person violates 
local law.
Example. Your significant other, T, lived 
with you as a member of your household all 
year. However, your relationship with T violated 
the laws of the state where you live because T 
was married to someone else. Therefore, T 
doesn't meet this test and you can’t claim T as a 
dependent.
Adopted child. An adopted child is always 
treated as your own child. The term “adopted 
child” includes a child who was lawfully placed 
with you for legal adoption.
Cousin. Your cousin must live with you all year 
as a member of your household to meet this 
test. A cousin is a descendant of a brother or 
sister of your father or mother.
Gross Income Test
To meet this test, a person's gross income for 
the year must be less than $4,400.
Gross income defined. Gross income is all 
income in the form of money, property, and 
services that isn't exempt from tax.
In a manufacturing, merchandising, or min-
ing business, gross income is the total net sales 
minus the cost of goods sold, plus any miscella-
neous income from the business.
Gross receipts from rental property are 
gross income. Don’t deduct taxes, repairs, or 
other expenses to determine the gross income 
from rental property.
Gross income includes a partner's share of 
the gross (not a share of the net) partnership 
income.
Gross income also includes all taxable un-
employment compensation, taxable social se-
curity benefits, and certain amounts received as 
scholarship and fellowship grants. Scholarships 
received by degree candidates and used for tui-
tion, fees, supplies, books, and equipment re-
quired for particular courses generally aren't in-
cluded in gross income. For more information 
about scholarships, see chapter 8.
Disabled dependent working at sheltered 
workshop. For purposes of the gross income 
test, the gross income of an individual who is 
permanently and totally disabled at any time 
during the year doesn't include income for serv-
ices the individual performs at a sheltered work-
shop. The availability of medical care at the 
workshop must be the main reason for the indi-
vidual's presence there. Also, the income must 
come solely from activities at the workshop that 
are incident to this medical care.
A “sheltered workshop” is a school that:
•
Provides special instruction or training de-
signed to alleviate the disability of the indi-
vidual; and
•
Is operated by certain tax-exempt organi-
zations, or by a state, a U.S. possession, a 
political subdivision of a state or posses-
sion, the United States, or the District of 
Columbia.
Permanently and totally disabled has the 
same meaning here as under Qualifying Child, 
earlier.
Support Test (To Be a Qualifying 
Relative)
To meet this test, you must generally provide 
more than half of a person's total support during 
the calendar year.
However, if two or more persons provide 
support, but no one person provides more than 
half of a person's total support, see Multiple 
Support Agreement, later.
How to determine if support test is met. 
You figure whether you have provided more 
than half of a person's total support by compar-
ing the amount you contributed to that person's 
support with the entire amount of support that 
person received from all sources. This includes 
support the person provided from the person’s 
own funds.
You may find Worksheet 3-1 helpful in figur-
ing whether you provided more than half of a 
person's support.
Person's own funds not used for support. 
A person's own funds aren't support unless they 
are actually spent for support.
Example. Your parent received $2,400 in 
social security benefits and $300 in interest, 
paid $2,000 for lodging and $400 for recreation, 
and put $300 in a savings account.
Even though your parent received a total of 
$2,700 ($2,400 + $300), your parent spent only 
$2,400 ($2,000 + $400) for your parent’s own 
support. If you spent more than $2,400 for your 
parent’s support and no other support was re-
ceived, you have provided more than half of 
your parent’s support.
Child's wages used for own support. You 
can’t include in your contribution to your child's 
Chapter 3 Dependents Page 33

support any support paid for by the child with 
the child's own wages, even if you paid the wa-
ges.
Year support is provided. The year you pro-
vide the support is the year you pay for it, even 
if you do so with borrowed money that you re-
pay in a later year.
If you use a fiscal year to report your in-
come, you must provide more than half of the 
dependent's support for the calendar year in 
which your fiscal year begins.
Armed Forces dependency allotments. The 
part of the allotment contributed by the govern-
ment and the part taken out of your military pay 
are both considered provided by you in figuring 
whether you provide more than half of the sup-
port. If your allotment is used to support per-
sons other than those you name, you can claim 
them as dependents if they otherwise qualify.
Example. You are in the Armed Forces. 
You authorize an allotment for your surviving 
parent that your surviving parent uses to sup-
port themselves and their sibling. If the allot-
ment provides more than half of each person's 
support, you can claim each of them as a de-
pendent, if they otherwise qualify, even though 
you authorize the allotment only for your surviv-
ing parent.
Tax-exempt military quarters allowances. 
These allowances are treated the same way as 
dependency allotments in figuring support. The 
allotment of pay and the tax-exempt basic al-
lowance for quarters are both considered as 
provided by you for support.
Tax-exempt income. In figuring a person's to-
tal support, include tax-exempt income, sav-
ings, and borrowed amounts used to support 
that person. Tax-exempt income includes cer-
tain social security benefits, welfare benefits, 
nontaxable life insurance proceeds, Armed 
Forces family allotments, nontaxable pensions, 
and tax-exempt interest.
Example 1. You provide $4,000 towards 
your parent’s support during the year. Your pa-
rent has earned income of $600, nontaxable so-
cial security benefits of $4,800, and tax-exempt 
interest of $200, all of which your parent uses 
for self-support. You can’t claim your parent as 
a dependent because the $4,000 you provide 
isn’t more than half of your parent’s total sup-
port of $9,600 ($4,000 + $600 +$4,800 + $200).
Example 2. K, your sibling’s child, takes 
out a student loan of $2,500 and uses it to pay 
college tuition. K is personally responsible for 
the loan. You provide $2,000 toward K’s total 
support. You can’t claim K as a dependent be-
cause you provide less than half of K’s support.
Social security benefits. If a married cou-
ple receives benefits that are paid by one check 
made out to both of them, half of the total paid 
is considered to be for the support of each 
spouse, unless they can show otherwise.
If a child receives social security benefits 
and uses them toward their own support, the 
benefits are considered as provided by the 
child.
Support provided by the state (welfare, 
food 
stamps, 
housing, 
etc.). Benefits 
provided by the state to a needy person are 
generally considered support provided by the 
state. However, payments based on the needs 
of the recipient won't be considered as used en-
tirely for that person's support if it is shown that 
part of the payments weren't used for that pur-
pose.
Foster care. Payments you receive for the 
support of a foster child from a child placement 
agency are considered support provided by the 
agency. See Foster care payments and expen-
ses, earlier.
Home for the aged. If you make a lump-sum 
advance payment to a home for the aged to 
take care of your relative for life and the pay-
ment is based on that person's life expectancy, 
the amount of support you provide each year is 
the lump-sum payment divided by the relative's 
life expectancy. The amount of support you pro-
vide also includes any other amounts you provi-
ded during the year.
Total Support
To figure if you provided more than half of a 
person's support, you must first determine the 
total support provided for that person. Total 
support includes amounts spent to provide 
food, lodging, clothing, education, medical and 
dental care, recreation, transportation, and sim-
ilar necessities.
Generally, the amount of an item of support 
is the amount of the expense incurred in provid-
ing that item. For lodging, the amount of support 
is the fair rental value of the lodging.
Expenses not directly related to any one 
member of a household, such as the cost of 
food for the household, must be divided among 
the members of the household.
Example 1. G Brown, parent of M Miller, 
lives with F and M Miller and their two children. 
G gets social security benefits of $2,400, which 
G spends for clothing, transportation, and rec-
reation. G has no other income. F and M's total 
food expense for the household is $5,200. They 
pay G's medical and drug expenses of $1,200. 
The fair rental value of the lodging provided for 
G is $1,800 a year, based on the cost of similar 
rooming facilities. Figure G's total support as 
follows.

$6,440 
The support F and M provide, $4,040 
($1,800 lodging + $1,200 medical expenses + 
$1,040 food), is more than half of G's $6,440 to-
tal support.
Example 2. Your parents, A and B, live with 
you, your spouse, and your two children in a 
house you own. The fair rental value of your pa-
rents' share of the lodging is $2,000 a year 
($1,000 each), which includes furnishings and 
utilities. A receives a nontaxable pension of 
$4,200, which A spends equally between A and 
B for items of support such as clothing, trans-
portation, and recreation. Your total food ex-
pense for the household is $6,000. Your heat 
and utility bills amount to $1,200. B has hospital 
and medical expenses of $600, which you pay 
during the year. Figure your parents' total sup-
port as follows.

$4,100 
$4,700 
You must apply the support test separately 
to each parent. You provide $2,000 ($1,000 
lodging + $1,000 food) of A’s total support of 
$4,100—less than half. You provide $2,600 to B 
($1,000 lodging + $1,000 food + $600 medi-
cal)—more than half of B’s total support of 
$4,700. You meet the support test for B, but not 
A. Heat and utility costs are included in the fair 
rental value of the lodging, so these aren't con-
sidered separately.
Lodging. If you provide a person with lodging, 
you are considered to provide support equal to 
the fair rental value of the room, apartment, 
house, or other shelter in which the person 
lives. Fair rental value includes a reasonable al-
lowance for the use of furniture and appliances, 
and for heat and other utilities that are provided.
Fair rental value defined. Fair rental value 
is the amount you could reasonably expect to 
receive from a stranger for the same kind of 
lodging. It is used instead of actual expenses 
such as taxes, interest, depreciation, paint, in-
surance, utilities, and the cost of furniture and 
appliances. In some cases, fair rental value 
may be equal to the rent paid.
If you provide the total lodging, the amount 
of support you provide is the fair rental value of 
the room the person uses, or a share of the fair 
rental value of the entire dwelling if the person 
has use of your entire home. If you don’t pro-
vide the total lodging, the total fair rental value 
must be divided depending on how much of the 
total lodging you provide. If you provide only a 
part and the person supplies the rest, the fair 
rental value must be divided between both of 
you according to the amount each provides.
Example. Your parents live rent free in a 
house you own. It has a fair rental value of 
$5,400 a year furnished, which includes a fair 
rental value of $3,600 for the house and $1,800 
for the furniture. This doesn't include heat and 
utilities. The house is completely furnished with 
furniture belonging to your parents. You pay 
$600 for their utility bills. Utilities usually aren't 
included in rent for houses in the area where 
your parents live. Therefore, you consider the 
total fair rental value of the lodging to be $6,000 
($3,600 fair rental value of the unfurnished 
house + $1,800 allowance for the furnishings 
provided by your parents + $600 cost of utilities) 
of which you are considered to provide $4,200 
($3,600 + $600).
Page 34 Chapter 3 Dependents

Person living in their own home. The total 
fair rental value of a person's home that the per-
son owns is considered support contributed by 
that person.
Living with someone rent free. If you live 
with a person rent free in that person’s home, 
you must reduce the amount you provide for 
support of that person by the fair rental value of 
lodging the person provides you.
Property. Property provided as support is 
measured by its fair market value. Fair market 
value is the price that property would sell for on 
the open market. It is the price that would be 
agreed upon between a willing buyer and a will-
ing seller, with neither being required to act, and 
both having reasonable knowledge of the rele-
vant facts.
Capital expenses. Capital items, such as 
furniture, appliances, and cars, bought for a 
person during the year can be included in total 
support under certain circumstances.
The following examples show when a capi-
tal item is or isn't support.
Example 1. You buy a $200 power lawn 
mower for your 13-year-old child. The child is 
given the duty of keeping the lawn trimmed. Be-
cause the lawn mower benefits all members of 
the household, don’t include the cost of the 
lawn mower in the support of your child.
Example 2. You buy a $150 television set 
as a birthday present for your 12-year-old child. 
The television set is placed in your child's bed-
room. You can include the cost of the television 
set in the support of your child.
Example 3. You pay $5,000 for a car and 
register it in your name. You and your 
17-year-old child use the car equally. Because 
you own the car and don’t give it to your child 
but merely let your child use it, don’t include the 
cost of the car in your child’s total support. How-
ever, you can include in your child's support 
your out-of-pocket expenses of operating the 
car for your child’s benefit.
Example 4. Your 17-year-old child, using 
personal funds, buys a car for $4,500. You pro-
vide the rest of your child's support, $4,000. Be-
cause the car is bought and owned by your 
child, the car's fair market value ($4,500) must 
be included in your child’s support. Your child 
has provided more than half of their own total 
support of $8,500 ($4,500 + $4,000), so this 
child isn't your qualifying child. You didn't pro-
vide more than half of this child’s total support, 
so this child isn't your qualifying relative. You 
can’t claim this child as a dependent.
Medical insurance premiums. Medical insur-
ance premiums you pay, including premiums for 
supplementary Medicare coverage, are inclu-
ded in the support you provide.
Medical insurance benefits. Medical in-
surance benefits, including basic and supple-
mentary Medicare benefits, aren't part of sup-
port.
Tuition payments and allowances under the 
GI Bill. Amounts veterans receive under the GI 
Bill for tuition payments and allowances while 
they attend school are included in total support.
Example. During the year, your child re-
ceives $2,200 from the government under the 
GI Bill. Your child uses this amount for your 
child’s education. You provide the rest of his 
support, $2,000. Because GI benefits are inclu-
ded in total support, your child’s total support is 
$4,200 ($2,200 + $2,000). You haven't provided 
more than half of your child’s support.
Childcare expenses. If you pay someone to 
provide child or dependent care, you can in-
clude these payments in the amount you provi-
ded for the support of your child or disabled de-
pendent, even if you claim a credit for the 
payments. For information on the credit, see 
Pub. 503, Child and Dependent Care Expen-
ses.
Other support items. Other items may be 
considered as support depending on the facts 
in each case.
Don’t Include in Total Support
The following items aren't included in total sup-
port.
1. Federal, state, and local income taxes 
paid by persons from their own income. 
2. Social security and Medicare taxes paid 
by persons from their own income. 
3. Life insurance premiums. 
4. Funeral expenses. 
5. Scholarships received by your child if your 
child is a student.
6. Survivors' and Dependents' Educational 
Assistance payments used for the support 
of the child who receives them.
Multiple Support Agreement
Sometimes no one provides more than half of 
the support of a person. Instead, two or more 
persons, each of whom would be able to claim 
the person as a dependent but for the support 
test, together provide more than half of the per-
son's support.
When this happens, you can agree that any 
one of you who individually provides more than 
10% of the person's support, but only one, can 
claim the person as a dependent. Each of the 
others must sign a statement agreeing not to 
claim the person as a dependent for that year. 
The person who claims the person as a de-
pendent must keep these signed statements for 
their own records. A multiple support declara-
tion identifying each of the others who agreed 
not to claim the person as a dependent must be 
attached to the return of the person claiming the 
person as a dependent. Form 2120 can be 
used for this purpose.
You can claim someone as a dependent un-
der a multiple support agreement for someone 
related to you or for someone who lived with 
you all year as a member of your household.
Example 1. You, and your siblings, S, B, 
and D, provide the entire support of your parent 
for the year. You provide 45%, S provides 35%, 
and B and D each provide 10%. Either you or S 
can claim your parent as a dependent; the one 
who doesn’t must sign a statement agreeing not 
to claim your parent as a dependent. The one 
who claims your parent as a dependent must 
attach Form 2120, or a similar declaration, to 
their return and must keep the statement signed 
by the other for their records. Because neither B 
nor D provides more than 10% of the support, 
neither can claim your parent as a dependent 
and neither has to sign a statement.
Example 2. You and your sibling each pro-
vide 20% of your parent's support for the year. 
The remaining 60% of your parent’s support is 
provided equally by two persons who are unre-
lated. Your parent doesn't live with them. Be-
cause more than half of your parent’s support is 
provided by persons who can’t claim your pa-
rent as a dependent, no one can claim your pa-
rent as a dependent.
Support Test for Children of 
Divorced or Separated Parents (or 
Parents Who Live Apart)
In most cases, a child of divorced or separated 
parents (or parents who live apart) will be a 
qualifying child of one of the parents. See Chil-
dren of divorced or separated parents (or pa-
rents who live apart) under Qualifying Child, 
earlier. However, if the child doesn't meet the 
requirements to be a qualifying child of either 
parent, the child may be a qualifying relative of 
one of the parents. If you think this might apply 
to you, see Pub. 501.
Social Security 
Numbers (SSNs)
for Dependents
You must show the SSN of any dependent you 
list in the Dependents section of your Form 
1040 or 1040-SR.
If you don’t show the dependent's SSN 
when required, or if you show an incor-
rect SSN, certain tax benefits may be 
disallowed.
No SSN. If a person whom you expect to claim 
as a dependent on your return doesn't have an 
SSN, either you or that person should apply for 
an SSN as soon as possible by filing Form 
SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, 
with the Social Security Administration (SSA). 
You can get Form SS-5 online at SSA.gov/
forms/ss-5.pdf or at your local SSA office.
It usually takes about 2 weeks to get an SSN 
once the SSA has all the information it needs. If 
you don’t have a required SSN by the filing due 
date, you can file Form 4868 for an extension of 
time to file.
Born and died in 2022. If your child was 
born and died in 2022, and you don’t have an 
SSN for the child, you may attach a copy of the 
child's birth certificate, death certificate, or hos-
pital records instead. The document must show 
the child was born alive. If you do this, enter 
“DIED” in column (2) of the Dependents section 
of your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. 
Alien or adoptee with no SSN. If your de-
pendent doesn't have and can’t get an SSN, 
you must show the ITIN or adoption taxpayer 
identification number (ATIN) instead of an SSN.
CAUTION
!
Chapter 3 Dependents Page 35

Taxpayer identification numbers for ali-
ens. If your dependent is a resident or nonresi-
dent alien who doesn't have and isn't eligible to 
get an SSN, your dependent must apply for an 
ITIN. For details on how to apply, see Form 
W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer 
Identification Number.
Taxpayer 
identification 
numbers 
for 
adoptees. If you have a child who was placed 
with you by an authorized placement agency, 
you may be able to claim the child as a depend-
ent. However, if you can’t get an SSN or an ITIN 
for the child, you must get an adoption taxpayer 
identification number (ATIN) for the child from 
the IRS. See Form W-7A, Application for Tax-
payer Identification Number for Pending U.S. 
Adoptions, for details.

Tax Withholding 
and Estimated 
Tax
What's New for 2023
Tax law changes for 2023. When you figure 
how much income tax you want withheld from 
your pay and when you figure your estimated 
tax, consider tax law changes effective in 2023. 
For more information, see Pub. 505, Tax With-
holding and Estimated Tax.
Reminders
Estimated tax safe harbor for higher in-
come taxpayers. If your 2022 adjusted gross 
income was more than $150,000 ($75,000 if 
you are married filing a separate return), you 
must pay the smaller of 90% of your expected 
tax for 2023 or 110% of the tax shown on your 
2022 return to avoid an estimated tax penalty.
Introduction
This chapter discusses how to pay your tax as 
you earn or receive income during the year. In 
general, 
the 
federal 
income 
tax 
is 
a 
pay-as-you-go tax. There are two ways to pay 
as you go.
•
Withholding. If you are an employee, your 
employer probably withholds income tax 
from your pay. Tax may also be withheld 
from certain other income, such as pen-
sions, bonuses, commissions, and gam-
bling winnings. The amount withheld is 
paid to the IRS in your name. 
•
Estimated tax. If you don't pay your tax 
through withholding, or don't pay enough 
tax that way, you may have to pay estima-
ted tax. People who are in business for 
themselves will generally have to pay their 
tax this way. Also, you may have to pay es-
timated tax if you receive income such as 
dividends, interest, capital gains, rent, and 
royalties. Estimated tax is used to pay not 
only income tax, but self-employment tax 
and alternative minimum tax as well. 
This chapter explains these methods. In ad-
dition, it also explains the following.
•
Credit for withholding and estimated 
tax. When you file your 2022 income tax 
return, take credit for all the income tax 
withheld from your salary, wages, pen-
sions, etc., and for the estimated tax you 
paid for 2022. Also take credit for any ex-
cess social security or railroad retirement 
tax withheld. See Pub. 505.
•
Underpayment penalty. If you didn't pay 
enough tax during the year, either through 
withholding or by making estimated tax 
payments, you may have to pay a penalty. 
In most cases, the IRS can figure this pen-
alty for you. See Underpayment Penalty for 
2022 at the end of this chapter.

Salaries and Wages
Income tax is withheld from the pay of most em-
ployees. Your pay includes your regular pay, 
bonuses, commissions, and vacation allowan-
ces. It also includes reimbursements and other 
expense allowances paid under a nonaccounta-
ble plan. See Supplemental Wages, later, for 
more information about reimbursements and al-
lowances paid under a nonaccountable plan.
If your income is low enough that you won't 
have to pay income tax for the year, you may be 
exempt from withholding. This is explained un-
der Exemption From Withholding, later.
You can ask your employer to withhold in-
come tax from noncash wages and other wages 
not subject to withholding. If your employer 
doesn't agree to withhold tax, or if not enough is 
withheld, you may have to pay estimated tax, as 
discussed later under Estimated Tax for 2023.
Military retirees. Military retirement pay is 
treated in the same manner as regular pay for 
income tax withholding purposes, even though 
it is treated as a pension or annuity for other tax 
purposes.
Household workers. If you are a household 
worker, you can ask your employer to withhold 
income tax from your pay. A household worker 
is an employee who performs household work 
in a private home, local college club, or local 
fraternity or sorority chapter.
Tax is withheld only if you want it withheld 
and your employer agrees to withhold it. If you 
don't have enough income tax withheld, you 
may have to pay estimated tax, as discussed 
later under Estimated Tax for 2023.
Farmworkers. Generally, income tax is with-
held from your cash wages for work on a farm 
unless your employer does both of these:
•
Pays you cash wages of less than $150 
during the year, and
•
Has expenditures for agricultural labor to-
taling less than $2,500 during the year.
Differential wage payments. When employ-
ees are on leave from employment for military 
duty, some employers make up the difference 
between the military pay and civilian pay. Pay-
ments to an employee who is on active duty for 
a period of more than 30 days will be subject to 
income tax withholding, but not subject to social 
security, Medicare, or federal unemployment 
(FUTA) tax withholding. The wages and with-
holding will be reported on Form W-2, Wage 
and Tax Statement.
Determining Amount of Tax 
Withheld Using Form W-4
The amount of income tax your employer with-
holds from your regular pay depends on two 
things.
•
The amount you earn in each payroll pe-
riod.
•
The information you give your employer on 
Form W-4.
Page 36 Chapter 4 Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax

Form W-4 includes steps to help you figure 
your withholding. Complete Steps 2 through 4 
only if they apply to you.
•
Step 1. Enter your personal information in-
cluding your filing status.
•
Step 2. Complete this step if you have 
more than one job at the same time or are 
married filing jointly and you and your 
spouse both work.
•
Step 3. Complete this step if you claim de-
pendents and other credits.
•
Step 4. Complete this optional step to 
make other adjustments.
*Other income
*Deductions
*Extra withholding
New Job
When you start a new job, you must fill out Form 
W-4 and give it to your employer. Your em-
ployer should have copies of the form. If you 
need to change the information later, you must 
fill out a new form.
If you work only part of the year (for exam-
ple, you start working after the beginning of the 
year), too much tax may be withheld. You may 
be able to avoid overwithholding if your em-
ployer agrees to use the part-year method. See 
Part-Year Method in chapter 1 of Pub. 505 for 
more information.
Employee also receiving pension income. 
If you receive pension or annuity income and 
begin a new job, you will need to file Form W-4 
with your new employer. However, you can 
choose to split your withholding between your 
pension and job in any manner.
Changing Your Withholding
During the year, changes may occur to your 
marital status, adjustments, deductions, or 
credits you expect to claim on your tax return. 
When this happens, you may need to give your 
employer a new Form W-4 to change your with-
holding status.
If a change in personal circumstances re-
duces the amount of withholding you are enti-
tled to claim, you are required to give your em-
ployer a new Form W-4 within 10 days after the 
change occurs.
Changing your withholding for 2024. If 
events in 2023 will change the amount of with-
holding you should claim for 2024, you must 
give your employer a new Form W-4 by Decem-
ber 1, 2023. If the event occurs in December 
2023, submit a new Form W-4 within 10 days.
Checking Your Withholding
After you have given your employer a Form 
W-4, you can check to see whether the amount 
of tax withheld from your pay is too little or too 
much. If too much or too little tax is being with-
held, you should give your employer a new 
Form W-4 to change your withholding. You 
should try to have your withholding match your 
actual tax liability. If not enough tax is withheld, 
you will owe tax at the end of the year and may 
have to pay interest and a penalty. If too much 
tax is withheld, you will lose the use of that 
money until you get your refund. Always check 
your withholding if there are personal or finan-
cial changes in your life or changes in the law 
that might change your tax liability.
Note. You can’t give your employer a pay-
ment to cover withholding on salaries and wa-
ges for past pay periods or a payment for esti-
mated tax.
Completing Form W-4 and 
Worksheets
Form W-4 has worksheets to help you figure the 
correct amount of withholding you can claim. 
The worksheets are for your own records. Don't 
give them to your employer.
Multiple Jobs Worksheet. If you have income 
from more than one job at the same time, or are 
married filing jointly and you and your spouse 
both work, complete the Multiple Jobs Work-
sheet on the Form W-4.
If you and your spouse expect to file sepa-
rate returns, figure your withholding using sepa-
rate worksheets based on your own individual 
income, adjustments, deductions, and credits.
Deductions Worksheet. Use the Deductions 
Worksheet on Form W-4 if you plan to itemize 
deductions or claim certain adjustments to in-
come and you want to reduce your withholding. 
Also complete this worksheet when you have 
changes to these items to see if you need to 
change your withholding.
Getting the Right Amount of Tax 
Withheld
In most situations, the tax withheld from your 
pay will be close to the tax you figure on your 
return if you follow these two rules.
•
You accurately complete all the Form W-4 
worksheets that apply to you.
•
You give your employer a new Form W-4 
when changes occur.
But because the worksheets and withhold-
ing methods don't account for all possible situa-
tions, you may not be getting the right amount 
withheld. This is most likely to happen in the fol-
lowing situations.
•
You are married and both you and your 
spouse work.
•
You have more than one job at a time.
•
You have nonwage income, such as inter-
est, dividends, alimony, unemployment 
compensation, or self-employment in-
come.
•
You will owe additional amounts with your 
return, such as self-employment tax.
•
Your withholding is based on obsolete 
Form W-4 information for a substantial part 
of the year.
•
You work only part of the year.
•
You change the amount of your withhold-
ing during the year.
•
You are subject to Additional Medicare Tax 
or Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT). If you 
anticipate liability for Additional Medicare 
Tax or NIIT, you may request that your em-
ployer withhold an additional amount of 
income tax withholding on Form W-4.
Cumulative wage method. If you change the 
amount of your withholding during the year, too 
much or too little tax may have been withheld 
for the period before you made the change. You 
may be able to compensate for this if your em-
ployer agrees to use the cumulative wage with-
holding method for the rest of the year. You 
must ask your employer in writing to use this 
method.
To be eligible, you must have been paid for 
the same kind of payroll period (weekly, bi-
weekly, etc.) since the beginning of the year.
Publication 505
To make sure you are getting the right amount 
of tax withheld, get Pub. 505. It will help you 
compare the total tax to be withheld during the 
year with the tax you can expect to figure on 
your return. It will also help you determine how 
much, if any, additional withholding is needed 
each payday to avoid owing tax when you file 
your return. If you don't have enough tax with-
held, you may have to pay estimated tax, as ex-
plained under Estimated Tax for 2023, later.
You can use the Tax Withholding Esti-
mator at IRS.gov/W4App, instead of 
Pub. 505 or the worksheets included 
with Form W-4, to determine whether you need 
to have your withholding increased or de-
creased.
Rules Your Employer Must Follow
It may be helpful for you to know some of the 
withholding rules your employer must follow. 
These rules can affect how to fill out your Form 
W-4 and how to handle problems that may 
arise.
New Form W-4. When you start a new job, 
your employer should have you complete a 
Form W-4. Beginning with your first payday, 
your employer will use the information you give 
on the form to figure your withholding.
If you later fill out a new Form W-4, your em-
ployer can put it into effect as soon as possible. 
The deadline for putting it into effect is the start 
of the first payroll period ending 30 or more 
days after you turn it in.
No Form W-4. If you don't give your employer 
a completed Form W-4, your employer must 
withhold at the highest rate, as if you were sin-
gle.
Repaying withheld tax. If you find you are 
having too much tax withheld because you 
didn't claim the correct amount of withholding 
you are entitled to, you should give your em-
ployer a new Form W-4. Your employer can’t re-
pay any of the tax previously withheld. Instead, 
claim the full amount withheld when you file 
your tax return.
However, if your employer has withheld 
more than the correct amount of tax for the 
Form W-4 you have in effect, you don't have to 
fill out a new Form W-4 to have your withholding 
lowered to the correct amount. Your employer 
can repay the amount that was withheld incor-
rectly. If you aren’t repaid, your Form W-2 will 
reflect the full amount actually withheld, which 
you would claim when you file your tax return.
TIP
Chapter 4 Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax Page 37

Exemption From Withholding
If you claim exemption from withholding, your 
employer won't withhold federal income tax 
from your wages. The exemption applies only to 
income tax, not to social security, Medicare, or 
FUTA tax withholding.
You can claim exemption from withholding 
for 2023 only if both of the following situations 
apply.
•
For 2022, you had a right to a refund of all 
federal income tax withheld because you 
had no tax liability.
•
For 2023, you expect a refund of all federal 
income tax withheld because you expect to 
have no tax liability.
Students. If you are a student, you aren’t auto-
matically exempt. See chapter 1 to find out if 
you must file a return. If you work only part time 
or only during the summer, you may qualify for 
exemption from withholding.
Age 65 or older or blind. If you are 65 or 
older or blind, use Worksheet 1-1 or 1-2 in 
chapter 1 of Pub. 505 to help you decide if you 
qualify for exemption from withholding. Don't 
use either worksheet if you will itemize deduc-
tions or claim tax credits on your 2023 return. 
Instead, see Itemizing deductions or claiming 
credits in chapter 1 of Pub. 505.
Claiming exemption from withholding.  To 
claim exemption, you must give your employer 
a Form W-4. Write “Exempt” on the form in the 
space below Step 4(c) and complete the appli-
cable steps of the form.
If you claim exemption, but later your situa-
tion changes so that you will have to pay in-
come tax after all, you must file a new Form 
W-4 within 10 days after the change. If you 
claim exemption in 2023, but you expect to owe 
income tax for 2024, you must file a new Form 
W-4 by December 1, 2023.
Your claim of exempt status may be re-
viewed by the IRS.
An exemption is good for only 1 year. 
You must give your employer a new Form W-4 
by February 15 each year to continue your ex-
emption.
Supplemental Wages
Supplemental wages include bonuses, commis-
sions, overtime pay, vacation allowances, cer-
tain sick pay, and expense allowances under 
certain plans. The payer can figure withholding 
on supplemental wages using the same method 
used for your regular wages. However, if these 
payments are identified separately from your 
regular wages, your employer or other payer of 
supplemental wages can withhold income tax 
from these wages at a flat rate.
Expense 
allowances. Reimbursements 
or 
other expense allowances paid by your em-
ployer under a nonaccountable plan are treated 
as supplemental wages.
Reimbursements or other expense allowan-
ces paid under an accountable plan that are 
more than your proven expenses are treated as 
paid under a nonaccountable plan if you don't 
return the excess payments within a reasonable 
period of time.
For more information about accountable and 
nonaccountable expense allowance plans, see 
Pub. 505.
Penalties
You may have to pay a penalty of $500 if both 
of the following apply.
•
You make statements or claim withholding 
on your Form W-4 that reduce the amount 
of tax withheld.
•
You have no reasonable basis for those 
statements or withholding at the time you 
prepare your Form W-4.
There is also a criminal penalty for willfully 
supplying false or fraudulent information on 
your Form W-4 or for willfully failing to supply in-
formation that would increase the amount with-
held. The penalty upon conviction can be either 
a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment for up to 
1 year, or both.
These penalties will apply if you deliberately 
and knowingly falsify your Form W-4 in an at-
tempt to reduce or eliminate the proper with-
holding of taxes. A simple error or an honest 
mistake won't result in one of these penalties.
Tips
The tips you receive while working on your job 
are considered part of your pay. You must in-
clude your tips on your tax return on the same 
line as your regular pay. However, tax isn't with-
held directly from tip income, as it is from your 
regular pay. Nevertheless, your employer will 
take into account the tips you report when figur-
ing how much to withhold from your regular pay.
For more information on reporting your tips 
to your employer and on the withholding rules 
for tip income, see Pub. 531, Reporting Tip In-
come.
How employer figures amount to withhold. 
The tips you report to your employer are coun-
ted as part of your income for the month you re-
port them. Your employer can figure your with-
holding in either of two ways.
•
By withholding at the regular rate on the 
sum of your pay plus your reported tips.
•
By withholding at the regular rate on your 
pay plus a percentage of your reported 
tips.
Not enough pay to cover taxes. If your regu-
lar pay isn't enough for your employer to with-
hold all the tax (including income tax and social 
security and Medicare taxes (or the equivalent 
railroad retirement tax)) due on your pay plus 
your tips, you can give your employer money to 
cover the shortage. See Pub. 531 for more in-
formation.
Allocated tips. Your employer shouldn't with-
hold income tax, Medicare tax, social security 
tax, or railroad retirement tax on any allocated 
tips. Withholding is based only on your pay plus 
your reported tips. Your employer should refund 
to you any incorrectly withheld tax. See Pub. 
531 for more information.
Taxable Fringe Benefits
The value of certain noncash fringe benefits you 
receive from your employer is considered part 
of your pay. Your employer must generally with-
hold income tax on these benefits from your 
regular pay.
For information on fringe benefits, see 
Fringe Benefits under Employee Compensation 
in chapter 5.
Although the value of your personal use of 
an employer-provided car, truck, or other high-
way motor vehicle is taxable, your employer can 
choose not to withhold income tax on that 
amount. Your employer must notify you if this 
choice is made.
For more information on withholding on tax-
able fringe benefits, see chapter 1 of Pub. 505.
Sick Pay
Sick pay is a payment to you to replace your 
regular wages while you are temporarily absent 
from work due to sickness or personal injury. To 
qualify as sick pay, it must be paid under a plan 
to which your employer is a party.
If you receive sick pay from your employer 
or an agent of your employer, income tax must 
be withheld. An agent who doesn't pay regular 
wages to you may choose to withhold income 
tax at a flat rate.
However, if you receive sick pay from a third 
party who isn't acting as an agent of your em-
ployer, income tax will be withheld only if you 
choose to have it withheld. See Form W-4S, 
later.
If you receive payments under a plan in 
which your employer doesn't participate (such 
as an accident or health plan where you paid all 
the premiums), the payments aren’t sick pay 
and usually aren’t taxable.
Union agreements. If you receive sick pay un-
der a collective bargaining agreement between 
your union and your employer, the agreement 
may determine the amount of income tax with-
holding. See your union representative or your 
employer for more information.
Form W-4S. If you choose to have income tax 
withheld from sick pay paid by a third party, 
such as an insurance company, you must fill out 
Form W-4S. Its instructions contain a worksheet 
you can use to figure the amount you want with-
held. They also explain restrictions that may ap-
ply.
Give the completed form to the payer of your 
sick pay. The payer must withhold according to 
your directions on the form.
Estimated tax. If you don't request withholding 
on Form W-4S, or if you don't have enough tax 
withheld, you may have to make estimated tax 
payments. If you don't pay enough tax, either 
through estimated tax or withholding, or a com-
bination of both, you may have to pay a penalty. 
See Underpayment Penalty for 2022 at the end 
of this chapter.
Pensions and Annuities
Income tax will usually be withheld from your 
pension or annuity distributions unless you 
Page 38 Chapter 4 Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax

choose not to have it withheld. This rule applies 
to distributions from:
•
A traditional individual retirement arrange-
ment (IRA);
•
A life insurance company under an endow-
ment, annuity, or life insurance contract;
•
A pension, annuity, or profit-sharing plan;
•
A stock bonus plan; and
•
Any other plan that defers the time you re-
ceive compensation.
The amount withheld depends on whether 
you receive payments spread out over more 
than 1 year (periodic payments), within 1 year 
(nonperiodic payments), or as an eligible roll-
over distribution (ERD). Income tax withholding 
from an ERD is mandatory.
More information. For more information on 
withholding on pensions and annuities, includ-
ing a discussion of Form W-4P, see Pensions 
and Annuities in chapter 1 of Pub. 505.
Gambling Winnings
Income tax is withheld at a flat 24% rate from 
certain kinds of gambling winnings.
Gambling winnings of more than $5,000 
from the following sources are subject to in-
come tax withholding.
•
Any sweepstakes; wagering pool, includ-
ing payments made to winners of poker 
tournaments; or lottery.
•
Any other wager, if the proceeds are at 
least 300 times the amount of the bet.
It doesn't matter whether your winnings are paid 
in cash, in property, or as an annuity. Winnings 
not paid in cash are taken into account at their 
fair market value.
Exception.  Gambling winnings from bingo, 
keno, and slot machines generally aren’t sub-
ject to income tax withholding. However, you 
may need to provide the payer with a social se-
curity number to avoid withholding. See Backup 
withholding on gambling winnings in chapter 1 
of Pub. 505. If you receive gambling winnings 
not subject to withholding, you may need to pay 
estimated tax. See Estimated Tax for 2023, 
later.
If you don't pay enough tax, either through 
withholding or estimated tax, or a combination 
of both, you may have to pay a penalty. See Un-
derpayment Penalty for 2022 at the end of this 
chapter.
Form W-2G. If a payer withholds income tax 
from your gambling winnings, you should re-
ceive a Form W-2G, Certain Gambling Win-
nings, showing the amount you won and the 
amount withheld. Report the tax withheld on 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 25c.
Unemployment 
Compensation
You can choose to have income tax withheld 
from unemployment compensation. To make 
this choice, fill out Form W-4V (or a similar form 
provided by the payer) and give it to the payer.
All unemployment compensation is taxable. 
If you don't have income tax withheld, you may 
have to pay estimated tax. See Estimated Tax 
for 2023, later.
If you don't pay enough tax, either through 
withholding or estimated tax, or a combination 
of both, you may have to pay a penalty. See Un-
derpayment Penalty for 2022 at the end of this 
chapter.
Federal Payments
You can choose to have income tax withheld 
from certain federal payments you receive. 
These payments are the following.
1. Social security benefits.
2. Tier 1 railroad retirement benefits.
3. Commodity credit corporation loans you 
choose to include in your gross income.
4. Payments under the Agricultural Act of 
1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.), as amen-
ded, or title II of the Disaster Assistance 
Act of 1988, that are treated as insurance 
proceeds and that you receive because:
a. Your crops were destroyed or dam-
aged by drought, flood, or any other 
natural disaster; or
b. You were unable to plant crops be-
cause of a natural disaster described 
in (a).
5. Any other payment under federal law as 
determined by the Secretary.
To make this choice, fill out Form W-4V (or a 
similar form provided by the payer) and give it 
to the payer.
If you don't choose to have income tax with-
held, you may have to pay estimated tax. See 
Estimated Tax for 2023, later.
If you don't pay enough tax, either through 
withholding or estimated tax, or a combination 
of both, you may have to pay a penalty. See Un-
derpayment Penalty for 2022 at the end of this 
chapter.
More information. For more information about 
the tax treatment of social security and railroad 
retirement benefits, see chapter 7. Get Pub. 
225, Farmer's Tax Guide, for information about 
the tax treatment of commodity credit corpora-
tion loans or crop disaster payments.
Backup Withholding
Banks or other businesses that pay you certain 
kinds of income must file an information return 
(Form 1099) with the IRS. The information re-
turn shows how much you were paid during the 
year. It also includes your name and taxpayer 
identification number (TIN). TINs are explained 
in chapter 1 under Social Security Number 
(SSN).
These payments generally aren’t subject to 
withholding. However, “backup” withholding is 
required in certain situations. Backup withhold-
ing can apply to most kinds of payments that 
are reported on Form 1099.
The payer must withhold at a flat 24% rate in 
the following situations.
•
You don't give the payer your TIN in the re-
quired manner.
•
The IRS notifies the payer that the TIN you 
gave is incorrect.
•
You are required, but fail, to certify that you 
aren’t subject to backup withholding.
•
The IRS notifies the payer to start withhold-
ing on interest or dividends because you 
have underreported interest or dividends 
on your income tax return. The IRS will do 
this only after it has mailed you four noti-
ces.
Go 
to 
IRS.gov/Businesses/Small-
Businesses-Self-Employed/Backup-
Withholding for more information on kinds of 
payments subject to backup withholding.
Penalties. There are civil and criminal penal-
ties for giving false information to avoid backup 
withholding. The civil penalty is $500. The crimi-
nal penalty, upon conviction, is a fine of up to 
$1,000 or imprisonment of up to 1 year, or both.
Estimated Tax for 2023
Estimated tax is the method used to pay tax on 
income that isn't subject to withholding. This in-
cludes income from self-employment, interest, 
dividends, alimony, rent, gains from the sale of 
assets, prizes, and awards. You may also have 
to pay estimated tax if the amount of income tax 
being withheld from your salary, pension, or 
other income isn't enough.
Estimated tax is used to pay both income 
tax and self-employment tax, as well as other 
taxes and amounts reported on your tax return. 
If you don't pay enough tax, either through with-
holding or estimated tax, or a combination of 
both, you may have to pay a penalty. If you 
don't pay enough by the due date of each pay-
ment period (see When To Pay Estimated Tax, 
later), you may be charged a penalty even if you 
are due a refund when you file your tax return. 
For information on when the penalty applies, 
see Underpayment Penalty for 2022 at the end 
of this chapter.
Who Doesn't Have To Pay 
Estimated Tax
If you receive salaries or wages, you can avoid 
having to pay estimated tax by asking your em-
ployer to take more tax out of your earnings. To 
do this, give a new Form W-4 to your employer. 
See chapter 1 of Pub. 505.
Estimated tax not required. You don't have 
to pay estimated tax for 2023 if you meet all 
three of the following conditions.
•
You had no tax liability for 2022.
•
You were a U.S. citizen or resident alien for 
the whole year.
•
Your 2022 tax year covered a 12-month 
period.
You had no tax liability for 2022 if your total 
tax was zero or you didn't have to file an income 
tax return. For the definition of “total tax” for 
2022, see Pub. 505, chapter 2.
Chapter 4 Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax Page 39

Who Must Pay Estimated 
Tax
If you owe additional tax for 2022, you may 
have to pay estimated tax for 2023.
You can use the following general rule as a 
guide during the year to see if you will have 
enough withholding, or if you should increase 
your withholding or make estimated tax pay-
ments.
General rule. In most cases, you must pay es-
timated tax for 2023 if both of the following ap-
ply.
1. You expect to owe at least $1,000 in tax 
for 2023, after subtracting your withholding 
and refundable credits.
2. You expect your withholding plus your re-
fundable credits to be less than the 
smaller of:
a. 90% of the tax to be shown on your 
2023 tax return, or
b. 100% of the tax shown on your 2022 
tax return (but see Special rules for 
farmers, fishermen, and higher in-
come taxpayers, later). Your 2022 tax 
return must cover all 12 months.
If the result from using the general rule 
above suggests that you won't have 
enough 
withholding, 
complete 
the 
2023 Estimated Tax Worksheet in Pub. 505 for 
a more accurate calculation.
Special rules for farmers, fishermen, and 
higher 
income 
taxpayers. If 
at 
least 
two-thirds of your gross income for tax year 
2022 or 2023 is from farming or fishing, 
CAUTION
!
substitute 662/3% for 90% in (2a) under the 
General rule, earlier. If your AGI for 2022 was 
more than $150,000 ($75,000 if your filing sta-
tus for 2023 is married filing a separate return), 
substitute 110% for 100% in (2b) under General 
rule, earlier. See Figure 4-A and Pub. 505, 
chapter 2, for more information.
Aliens.  Resident and nonresident aliens may 
also have to pay estimated tax. Resident aliens 
should follow the rules in this chapter unless no-
ted otherwise. Nonresident aliens should get 
Form 1040-ES (NR), U.S. Estimated Tax for 
Nonresident Alien Individuals.
You are an alien if you aren’t a citizen or na-
tional of the United States. You are a resident 
alien if you either have a green card or meet the 
substantial presence test. For more information 
about the substantial presence test, see Pub. 
519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.
Married taxpayers. If you qualify to make joint 
estimated tax payments, apply the rules dis-
cussed here to your joint estimated income.
You and your spouse can make joint estima-
ted tax payments even if you aren’t living to-
gether.
However, you and your spouse can’t make 
joint estimated tax payments if:
•
You are legally separated under a decree 
of divorce or separate maintenance,
•
You and your spouse have different tax 
years, or
•
Either spouse is a nonresident alien (un-
less that spouse elected to be treated as a 
resident alien for tax purposes (see chap-
ter 1 of Pub. 519)).
If you and your spouse can’t make estima-
ted tax payments, apply these rules to your sep-
arate estimated income. Making joint or sepa-
rate estimated tax payments won't affect your 
choice of filing a joint tax return or separate re-
turns for 2023.
2022 separate returns and 2023 joint re-
turn. If you plan to file a joint return with your 
spouse for 2023 but you filed separate returns 
for 2022, your 2022 tax is the total of the tax 
shown on your separate returns. You filed a 
separate return if you filed as single, head of 
household, or married filing separately.
2022 joint return and 2023 separate re-
turns. If you plan to file a separate return for 
2023 but you filed a joint return for 2022, your 
2022 tax is your share of the tax on the joint re-
turn. You file a separate return if you file as sin-
gle, head of household, or married filing sepa-
rately.
To figure your share of the tax on the joint 
return, first figure the tax both you and your 
spouse would have paid had you filed separate 
returns for 2022 using the same filing status as 
for 2023. Then, multiply the tax on the joint re-
turn by the following fraction.
The tax you would have paid had 
you filed a separate return
The total tax you and your 
spouse would have paid had 
you filed separate returns
Example. Taxpayer A and Taxpayer B filed 
a joint return for 2022 showing taxable income 
of $48,500 and tax of $5,412. Of the $48,500

How To Figure
Estimated Tax
To figure your estimated tax, you must figure 
your expected adjusted gross income (AGI), 
taxable income, taxes, deductions, and credits 
for the year.
When figuring your 2023 estimated tax, it 
may be helpful to use your income, deductions, 
and credits for 2022 as a starting point. Use 
your 2022 federal tax return as a guide. You 
can use Form 1040-ES and Pub. 505 to figure 
your estimated tax. Nonresident aliens use 
Form 1040-ES (NR) and Pub. 505 to figure esti-
mated tax (see chapter 8 of Pub. 519 for more 
information).
You must make adjustments both for 
changes in your own situation and for recent 
changes in the tax law. For a discussion of 
these changes, visit IRS.gov.
For more complete information on how to 
figure your estimated tax for 2023, see chap-
ter 2 of Pub. 505.
When To Pay Estimated 
Tax
For estimated tax purposes, the tax year is divi-
ded into four payment periods. Each period has 
a specific payment due date. If you don't pay 
enough tax by the due date of each payment 
period, you may be charged a penalty even if 
you are due a refund when you file your income 
tax return. The payment periods and due dates 
for estimated tax payments are shown next.
For the period:
Due date:*
Jan. 1–March 31 . . . . . . April 18
April 1–May 31 . . . . . . . June 15
June 1–August 31 . . . . .
Sept. 15
Sept. 1–Dec. 31 . . . . . .
Jan. 16, next year
.
*See Saturday, Sunday, holiday rule and 
January payment.
Saturday, Sunday, holiday rule. If the due 
date for an estimated tax payment falls on a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the pay-
ment will be on time if you make it on the next 
day that isn't a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holi-
day.
January payment. If you file your 2023 Form 
1040 or 1040-SR by January 31, 2024, and pay 
the rest of the tax you owe, you don't need to 
make the payment due on January 16, 2024.
Fiscal year taxpayers. If your tax year doesn't 
start on January 1, see the Form 1040-ES in-
structions for your payment due dates.
When To Start
You don't have to make estimated tax pay-
ments until you have income on which you will 
owe income tax. If you have income subject to 
estimated tax during the first payment period, 
you must make your first payment by the due 
date for the first payment period. You can pay 
all your estimated tax at that time, or you can 
pay it in installments. If you choose to pay in in-
stallments, make your first payment by the due 
date for the first payment period. Make your re-
maining installment payments by the due dates 
for the later periods.
No income subject to estimated tax during 
first period. If you don't have income subject 
to estimated tax until a later payment period, 
you must make your first payment by the due 
date for that period. You can pay your entire es-
timated tax by the due date for that period or 
you can pay it in installments by the due date 
for that period and the due dates for the remain-
ing periods.

How much to pay to avoid a penalty. To de-
termine how much you should pay by each pay-
ment due date, see How To Figure Each Pay-
ment next.
How To Figure
Each Payment
You should pay enough estimated tax by the 
due date of each payment period to avoid a 
penalty for that period. You can figure your re-
quired payment for each period by using either 
the regular installment method or the annual-
ized income installment method. These meth-
ods are described in chapter 2 of Pub. 505. If 
you don't pay enough during each payment pe-
riod, you may be charged a penalty even if you 
are due a refund when you file your tax return.
If the earlier discussion of No income sub-
ject to estimated tax during first period or the 
later discussion of Change in estimated tax ap-
plies to you, you may benefit from reading An-
nualized Income Installment Method in chap-
ter 2 of Pub. 505 for information on how to avoid 
a penalty.
Underpayment penalty. Under the regular in-
stallment method, if your estimated tax payment 
for any period is less than one-fourth of your es-
timated tax, you may be charged a penalty for 
underpayment of estimated tax for that period 
when you file your tax return. Under the annual-
ized income installment method, your estimated 
tax payments vary with your income, but the 
amount required must be paid each period. See 
Instructions for Form 2210 for more information.
Change in estimated tax. After you make an 
estimated tax payment, changes in your in-
come, adjustments, deductions, or credits may 
make it necessary for you to refigure your esti-
mated tax. Pay the unpaid balance of your 
amended estimated tax by the next payment 
due date after the change or in installments by 
that date and the due dates for the remaining 
payment periods.
Estimated Tax Payments
Not Required
You don't have to pay estimated tax if your with-
holding in each payment period is at least as 
much as:
•
One-fourth of your required annual pay-
ment, or
•
Your required annualized income install-
ment for that period.
You also don't have to pay estimated tax if you 
will pay enough through withholding to keep the 
amount you owe with your return under $1,000.
How To Pay Estimated Tax
There are several ways to pay estimated tax.
•
Credit an overpayment on your 2022 return 
to your 2023 estimated tax.
•
Pay by direct transfer from your bank ac-
count, or pay by debit or credit card using 
a pay-by-phone system or the Internet.
•
Send in your payment (check or money or-
der) with a payment voucher from Form 
1040-ES.
Credit an Overpayment
If you show an overpayment of tax after com-
pleting your Form 1040 or 1040-SR for 2022, 
you can apply part or all of it to your estimated 
tax for 2023. On line 36 of Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, enter the amount you want credited 
to your estimated tax rather than refunded. 
Take the amount you have credited into ac-
count when figuring your estimated tax pay-
ments.
You can’t have any of the amount you credi-
ted to your estimated tax refunded to you until 
you file your tax return for the following year. 
Chapter 4 Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax Page 41

You also can’t use that overpayment in any 
other way.
Pay Online
The IRS offers an electronic payment option 
that is right for you. Paying online is convenient, 
secure, and helps make sure we get your pay-
ments on time. To pay your taxes online or for 
more information, go to IRS.gov/Payments. You 
can pay using any of the following methods.
•
IRS Direct Pay. For online transfers di-
rectly from your checking or savings ac-
count at no cost to you, go to IRS.gov/
Payments.
•
Pay by Card. To pay by debit or credit 
card, go to IRS.gov/Payments. A conven-
ience fee is charged by these service pro-
viders.
•
Electronic Funds Withdrawal (EFW). 
This is an integrated e-file/e-pay option of-
fered only when filing your federal taxes 
electronically using tax preparation soft-
ware, through a tax professional, or the 
IRS at IRS.gov/Payments.
•
Online Payment Agreement. If you can’t 
pay in full by the due date of your tax re-
turn, you can apply for an online monthly 
installment agreement at IRS.gov/
Payments. Once you complete the online 
process, you will receive immediate notifi-
cation of whether your agreement has 
been approved. A user fee is charged.
•
IRS2GO. This is the mobile application of 
the IRS. You can access Direct Pay or Pay 
By Card by downloading the application.
Pay by Phone
Paying by phone is another safe and secure 
method of paying electronically. Use one of the 
following methods: (1) call one of the debit or 
credit card providers, or (2) use the Electronic 
Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS).
Debit or credit card. Call one of our service 
providers. Each charges a fee that varies by 
provider, card type, and payment amount.

Pay by Mobile Device
To pay through your mobile device, download 
the IRS2Go application.
Pay by Cash
Cash is an in-person payment option for individ-
uals provided through retail partners with a 
maximum of $1,000 per day per transaction. To 
make a cash payment, you must first be regis-
tered online at www.fed.acipayonline.com, our 
Official Payment provider.
Pay by Check or Money Order 
Using the Estimated Tax
Payment Voucher
Before submitting a payment through the mail 
using the estimated tax payment voucher, 
please consider alternative methods. One of 
our safe, quick, and easy electronic payment 
options might be right for you.
If you choose to mail in your payment, each 
payment of estimated tax by check or money 
order must be accompanied by a payment 
voucher from Form 1040-ES.
During 2022, if you:
•
Made at least one estimated tax payment 
but not by electronic means,
•
Didn't use software or a paid preparer to 
prepare or file your return,
then you should receive a copy of the 2023 
Form 1040-ES with payment vouchers.
The enclosed payment vouchers will be pre-
printed with your name, address, and social se-
curity number. Using the preprinted vouchers 
will speed processing, reduce the chance of er-
ror, and help save processing costs.
Use the window envelopes that came with 
your Form 1040-ES package. If you use your 
own envelopes, make sure you mail your pay-
ment vouchers to the address shown in the 
Form 1040-ES instructions for the place where 
you live.
No checks of $100 million or more accep-
ted.  The IRS can’t accept a single check (in-
cluding a cashier’s check) for amounts of 
$100,000,000 ($100 million) or more. If you are 
sending $100 million or more by check, you’ll 
need to spread the payment over two or more 
checks with each check made out for an 
amount less than $100 million. This limit doesn’t 
apply to other methods of payment (such as 
electronic 
payments). 
Please 
consider 
a 
method of payment other than check if the 
amount of the payment is over $100 million.
Note. These criteria can change without no-
tice. If you don't receive a Form 1040-ES pack-
age and you are required to make an estimated 
tax payment, you should go to IRS.gov/
Form1040ES and print a copy of Form 1040-ES 
that includes four blank payment vouchers. 
Complete one of these and make your payment 
timely to avoid penalties for paying late.
Don't use the address shown in the In-
structions for Form 1040 for your esti-
mated tax payments.
If you didn't pay estimated tax last year, you 
can order Form 1040-ES from the IRS (see the 
inside back cover of this publication) or 
CAUTION
!
download it from IRS.gov. Follow the instruc-
tions to make sure you use the vouchers cor-
rectly.
Joint estimated tax payments. If you file a 
joint return and are making joint estimated tax 
payments, enter the names and social security 
numbers on the payment voucher in the same 
order as they will appear on the joint return.
Change of address. You must notify the IRS if 
you are making estimated tax payments and 
you changed your address during the year. 
Complete Form 8822, Change of Address, and 
mail it to the address shown in the instructions 
for that form.
Credit for Withholding 
and Estimated Tax
for 2022
When you file your 2022 income tax return, take 
credit for all the income tax and excess social 
security or railroad retirement tax withheld from 
your salary, wages, pensions, etc. Also take 
credit for the estimated tax you paid for 2022. 
These credits are subtracted from your total tax. 
Because these credits are refundable, you 
should file a return and claim these credits, 
even if you don't owe tax.
Two or more employers.  If you had two or 
more employers in 2022 and were paid wages 
of more than $147,000, too much social secur-
ity or tier 1 railroad retirement tax may have 
been withheld from your pay. You may be able 
to claim the excess as a credit against your in-
come tax when you file your return. See the In-
structions for Form 1040 for more information.
Withholding
If you had income tax withheld during 2022, you 
should be sent a statement by January 31, 
2023, showing your income and the tax with-
held. Depending on the source of your income, 
you should receive:
•
Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement;
•
Form W-2G, Certain Gambling Winnings; 
or
•
A form in the 1099 series.
Forms W-2 and W-2G. If you file a paper re-
turn, always file Form W-2 with your income tax 
return. File Form W-2G with your return only if it 
shows any federal income tax withheld from 
your winnings.
You should get at least two copies of each 
form. If you file a paper return, attach one copy 
to the front of your federal income tax return. 
Keep one copy for your records. You should 
also receive copies to file with your state and lo-
cal returns.
Form W-2
Your employer is required to provide or send 
Form W-2 to you no later than January 31, 
2023. You should receive a separate Form W-2 
from each employer you worked for.
If you stopped working before the end of 
2022, your employer could have given you your 
Page 42 Chapter 4 Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax

Form W-2 at any time after you stopped work-
ing. However, your employer must provide or 
send it to you by January 31, 2023.
If you ask for the form, your employer must 
send it to you within 30 days after receiving your 
written request or within 30 days after your final 
wage payment, whichever is later.
If you haven't received your Form W-2 by 
January 31, you should ask your employer for it. 
If you don't receive it by early February, call the 
IRS.
Form W-2 shows your total pay and other 
compensation and the income tax, social secur-
ity tax, and Medicare tax that was withheld dur-
ing the year. Include the federal income tax 
withheld (as shown in box 2 of Form W-2) on 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 25a.
In addition, Form W-2 is used to report any 
taxable sick pay you received and any income 
tax withheld from your sick pay.
Form W-2G
If you had gambling winnings in 2022, the payer 
may have withheld income tax. If tax was with-
held, the payer will give you a Form W-2G 
showing the amount you won and the amount of 
tax withheld.
Report the amounts you won on Schedule 1 
(Form 1040). Take credit for the tax withheld on 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 25c.
The 1099 Series
Most forms in the 1099 series aren’t filed with 
your return. These forms should be furnished to 
you by January 31, 2023 (or, for Forms 1099-B, 
1099-S, and certain Forms 1099-MISC, by Feb-
ruary 15, 2023). Unless instructed to file any of 
these forms with your return, keep them for your 
records. There are several different forms in this 
series, which are not listed. See the instructions 
for the specific Form 1099 for more information.
Form 1099-R. Attach Form 1099-R to your pa-
per return if box 4 shows federal income tax 
withheld. Include the amount withheld in the to-
tal on line 25b of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
Backup withholding. If you were subject to 
backup withholding on income you received 
during 2022, include the amount withheld, as 
shown on your Form 1099, in the total on 
line 25b of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
Form Not Correct
If you receive a form with incorrect information 
on it, you should ask the payer for a corrected 
form. Call the telephone number or write to the 
address given for the payer on the form. The 
corrected Form W-2G or Form 1099 you re-
ceive will have an “X” in the “CORRECTED” box 
at the top of the form. A special form, Form 
W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, is 
used to correct a Form W-2.
In certain situations, you will receive two 
forms in place of the original incorrect form. 
This will happen when your taxpayer identifica-
tion number is wrong or missing, your name 
and address are wrong, or you received the 
wrong type of form (for example, a Form 
1099-DIV, Dividends and Distributions, instead 
of a Form 1099-INT, Interest Income). One new 
form you receive will be the same incorrect form 
or have the same incorrect information, but all 
money amounts will be zero. This form will have 
an “X” in the “CORRECTED” box at the top of 
the form. The second new form should have all 
the correct information, prepared as though it is 
the original (the “CORRECTED” box won't be 
checked).
Form Received After Filing
If you file your return and you later receive a 
form for income that you didn't include on your 
return, you should report the income and take 
credit for any income tax withheld by filing Form 
1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax 
Return.
Separate Returns
If you are married but file a separate return, you 
can take credit only for the tax withheld from 
your own income. Don't include any amount 
withheld from your spouse's income. However, 
different rules may apply if you live in a com-
munity property state.
Community property states are listed in 
chapter 2. For more information on these rules, 
and some exceptions, see Pub. 555, Commun-
ity Property.
Estimated Tax
Take credit for all your estimated tax payments 
for 2022 on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 26. In-
clude any overpayment from 2021 that you had 
credited to your 2022 estimated tax.
Name changed. If you changed your name, 
and you made estimated tax payments using 
your old name, attach a brief statement to the 
front of your paper tax return indicating:
•
When you made the payments,
•
The amount of each payment,
•
Your name when you made the payments, 
and
•
Your social security number.
The statement should cover payments you 
made jointly with your spouse as well as any 
you made separately.
Be sure to report the change to the Social 
Security Administration. This prevents delays in 
processing your return and issuing any refunds.
Separate Returns
If you and your spouse made separate estima-
ted tax payments for 2022 and you file separate 
returns, you can take credit only for your own 
payments.
If you made joint estimated tax payments, 
you must decide how to divide the payments 
between your returns. One of you can claim all 
of the estimated tax paid and the other none, or 
you can divide it in any other way you agree on. 
If you can’t agree, you must divide the pay-
ments in proportion to each spouse's individual 
tax as shown on your separate returns for 2022.
Divorced Taxpayers
If you made joint estimated tax payments for 
2022, and you were divorced during the year, 
either you or your former spouse can claim all of 
the joint payments, or you each can claim part 
of them. If you can’t agree on how to divide the 
payments, you must divide them in proportion 
to each spouse's individual tax as shown on 
your separate returns for 2022.
If you claim any of the joint payments on 
your tax return, enter your former spouse's so-
cial security number (SSN) in the space provi-
ded on the front of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If 
you divorced and remarried in 2022, enter your 
present spouse's SSN in the space provided on 
the front of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Also, on the 
dotted line next to line 26, enter your former 
spouse’s SSN, followed by “DIV.”
Underpayment Penalty 
for 2022
If you didn't pay enough tax, either through with-
holding or by making timely estimated tax pay-
ments, you will have an underpayment of esti-
mated tax and you may have to pay a penalty.
Generally, you won't have to pay a penalty 
for 2022 if any of the following apply.
•
The total of your withholding and estimated 
tax payments was at least as much as your 
2021 tax (or 110% of your 2021 tax if your 
AGI was more than $150,000, $75,000 if 
your 2022 filing status is married filing sep-
arately) and you paid all required estima-
ted tax payments on time;
•
The tax balance due on your 2022 return is 
no more than 10% of your total 2022 tax, 
and you paid all required estimated tax 
payments on time;
•
Your total 2022 tax minus your withholding 
and refundable credits is less than $1,000;
•
You didn't have a tax liability for 2021 and 
your 2021 tax year was 12 months; or
•
You didn't have any withholding taxes and 
your current year tax less any household 
employment taxes is less than $1,000.
Farmers and fishermen. Special rules apply if 
you are a farmer or fisherman. See the Instruc-
tions for Form 2210-F for more information.
IRS can figure the penalty for you. If you 
think you owe the penalty but you don't want to 
figure it yourself when you file your tax return, 
you may not have to. Generally, the IRS will fig-
ure the penalty for you and send you a bill. 
However, if you think you are able to lower or 
eliminate your penalty, you must complete 
Form 2210 or Form 2210-F and attach it to your 
paper return. See Instructions for Form 2210 for 
more information.

Form W-2. If you’re an employee, you should 
receive a Form W-2 from your employer show-
ing the pay you received for your services. In-
clude your pay on line 1 of Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, even if you don’t receive a Form W-2.
In some instances, your employer isn’t re-
quired to give you a Form W-2. Your employer 
isn’t required to give you a Form W-2 if you per-
form household work in your employer's home 
for less than $2,400 in cash wages during the 
calendar year and you have no federal income 
taxes withheld from your wages. Household 
work is work done in or around an employer's 
home. Some examples of workers who do 
household work are:
•
Babysitters,
•
Caretakers,
•
House cleaning workers,
•
Domestic workers,
•
Drivers,
•
Health aides,
•
Housekeepers,
•
Maids,
•
Nannies,
•
Private nurses, and
•
Yard workers.
See Schedule H (Form 1040), Household 
Employment Taxes, and its instructions, and 
Pub. 926 for more information.
If you performed services, other than as an 
independent contractor, and your employer 
didn’t withhold social security and Medicare 
taxes from your pay, you must file Form 8919, 
Uncollected Social Security and Medicare Tax 
on Wages, with your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. 
See Form 8919 and its instructions for more in-
formation on how to figure unreported wages 
and taxes and how to include them on your in-
come tax return.
Childcare providers. If you provide childcare, 
either in the child's home or in your home or 
other place of business, the pay you receive 
must be included in your income. If you aren’t 
an employee, you’re probably self-employed 
and must include payments for your services on 
Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From 
Business. You generally aren’t an employee un-
less you’re subject to the will and control of the 
person who employs you as to what you’re to 
do and how you’re to do it.
Babysitting. If you’re paid to babysit, even 
for relatives or neighborhood children, whether 
on a regular basis or only periodically, the rules 
for childcare providers apply to you.
Employment tax. Whether you're an em-
ployee or self-employed person, your income 
could be subject to self-employment tax. See 
the instructions for Schedules C and SE (Form 
1040) if you're self-employed. Also, see Pub. 
926 for more information.
Miscellaneous 
Compensation
This section discusses different types of em-
ployee compensation.
Advance commissions and other earnings. 
If you receive advance commissions or other 
amounts for services to be performed in the fu-
ture and you’re a cash-method taxpayer, you 
must include these amounts in your income in 
the year you receive them.
If you repay unearned commissions or other 
amounts in the same year you receive them, re-
duce the amount included in your income by the 
repayment. If you repay them in a later tax year, 
you can deduct the repayment as an itemized 
deduction on your Schedule A (Form 1040), 
line 16, or you may be able to take a credit for 
that year. See Repayments in chapter 8.
Allowances and reimbursements. If you re-
ceive travel, transportation, or other business 
expense allowances or reimbursements from 
your employer, see Pub. 463, Travel, Gift, and 
Car Expenses. If you’re reimbursed for moving 
expenses, see Pub. 521, Moving Expenses.
Back pay awards. If you receive an amount in 
payment of a settlement or judgment for back 
pay, you must include the amount of the pay-
ment in your income. This includes payments 
made to you for damages, unpaid life insurance 
premiums, and unpaid health insurance premi-
ums. They should be reported to you by your 
employer on Form W-2.
Bonuses and awards. If you receive a bonus 
or award (cash, goods, services, etc.) from your 
employer, you must include its value in your in-
come. However, if your employer merely prom-
ises to pay you a bonus or award at some future 
time, it isn’t taxable until you receive it or it’s 
made available to you.
Employee achievement award. If you re-
ceive tangible personal property (other than 
cash, a gift certificate, or an equivalent item) as 
an award for length of service or safety achieve-
ment, you can generally exclude its value from 
your income. The amount you can exclude is 
limited to your employer's cost and can’t be 
more than $1,600 for qualified plan awards or 
$400 for nonqualified plan awards for all such 
awards you receive during the year. Your em-
ployer can tell you whether your award is a 
qualified plan award. Your employer must make 
the award as part of a meaningful presentation, 
under conditions and circumstances that don’t 
create a significant likelihood of it being dis-
guised pay.
However, the exclusion doesn’t apply to the 
following awards.
•
A length-of-service award if you received it 
for less than 5 years of service or if you re-
ceived another length-of-service award 
during the year or the previous 4 years.
•
A safety achievement award if you’re a 
manager, administrator, clerical employee, 
or other professional employee or if more 
than 10% of eligible employees previously 
received safety achievement awards dur-
ing the year.
Example. Ben Green received three em-
ployee achievement awards during the year: a 
nonqualified plan award of a watch valued at 
$250, two qualified plan awards of a stereo val-
ued at $1,000, and a set of golf clubs valued at 
$500. Assuming that the requirements for quali-
fied plan awards are otherwise satisfied, each 
Chapter 5 Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings Page 45

award by itself would be excluded from income. 
However, because the $1,750 total value of the 
awards is more than $1,600, Ben must include 
$150 ($1,750 – $1,600) in his income.
Differential wage payments. This is any pay-
ment made to you by an employer for any pe-
riod during which you are, for a period of more 
than 30 days, an active duty member of the uni-
formed services and represents all or a portion 
of the wages you would have received from the 
employer during that period. These payments 
are treated as wages and are subject to income 
tax withholding, but not FICA or FUTA taxes. 
The payments are reported as wages on Form 
W-2.
Government 
cost-of-living 
allowances. 
Most payments received by U.S. Government 
civilian employees for working abroad are taxa-
ble. However, certain cost-of-living allowances 
are tax free. Pub. 516, U.S. Government Civil-
ian Employees Stationed Abroad, explains the 
tax treatment of allowances, differentials, and 
other special pay you receive for employment 
abroad.
Nonqualified deferred compensation plans. 
Your employer may report to you the total 
amount of deferrals for the year under a non-
qualified deferred compensation plan on Form 
W-2, box 12, using code Y. This amount isn’t in-
cluded in your income.
However, if at any time during the tax year, 
the plan fails to meet certain requirements, or 
isn’t operated under those requirements, all 
amounts deferred under the plan for the tax 
year and all preceding tax years to the extent 
vested and not previously included in income 
are included in your income for the current year. 
This amount is included in your wages shown 
on Form W-2, box 1. It’s also shown on Form 
W-2, box 12, using code Z.
Note received for services. If your employer 
gives you a secured note as payment for your 
services, you must include the fair market value 
(usually the discount value) of the note in your 
income for the year you receive it. When you 
later receive payments on the note, a propor-
tionate part of each payment is the recovery of 
the fair market value that you previously inclu-
ded in your income. Don’t include that part 
again in your income. Include the rest of the 
payment in your income in the year of payment.
If your employer gives you a nonnegotiable 
unsecured note as payment for your services, 
payments on the note that are credited toward 
the principal amount of the note are compensa-
tion income when you receive them.
Severance pay. If you receive a severance 
payment when your employment with your em-
ployer ends or is terminated, you must include 
this amount in your income.
Accrued leave payment. If you’re a federal 
employee and receive a lump-sum payment for 
accrued annual leave when you retire or resign, 
this amount will be included as wages on your 
Form W-2.
If you resign from one agency and are reem-
ployed by another agency, you may have to re-
pay part of your lump-sum annual leave pay-
ment to the second agency. You can reduce 
gross wages by the amount you repaid in the 
same tax year in which you received it. Attach 
to your tax return a copy of the receipt or state-
ment given to you by the agency you repaid to 
explain the difference between the wages on 
the return and the wages on your Forms W-2.
Outplacement services. If you choose to 
accept a reduced amount of severance pay so 
that you can receive outplacement services 
(such as training in résumé writing and inter-
view techniques), you must include the unre-
duced amount of the severance pay in income.
Sick pay. Pay you receive from your employer 
while you’re sick or injured is part of your salary 
or wages. In addition, you must include in your 
income sick pay benefits received from any of 
the following payers.
•
A welfare fund.
•
A state sickness or disability fund.
•
An association of employers or employees.
•
An insurance company, if your employer 
paid for the plan.
However, if you paid the premiums on an acci-
dent or health insurance policy yourself, the 
benefits you receive under the policy aren’t tax-
able. For more information, see Pub. 525, Taxa-
ble and Nontaxable Income.
Social security and Medicare taxes paid by 
employer. If you and your employer have an 
agreement that your employer pays your social 
security and Medicare taxes without deducting 
them from your gross wages, you must report 
the amount of tax paid for you as taxable wages 
on your tax return. The payment is also treated 
as wages for figuring your social security and 
Medicare taxes and your social security and 
Medicare benefits. However, these payments 
aren’t treated as social security and Medicare 
wages if you’re a household worker or a farm 
worker.
Stock appreciation rights. Don’t include a 
stock appreciation right granted by your em-
ployer in income until you exercise (use) the 
right. When you use the right, you’re entitled to 
a cash payment equal to the fair market value of 
the corporation's stock on the date of use minus 
the fair market value on the date the right was 
granted. You include the cash payment in your 
income in the year you use the right.
Fringe Benefits
Fringe benefits received in connection with the 
performance of your services are included in 
your income as compensation unless you pay 
fair market value for them or they’re specifically 
excluded by law. Refraining from the perform-
ance of services (for example, under a cove-
nant not to compete) is treated as the perform-
ance of services for purposes of these rules.
Accounting period. You must use the same 
accounting period your employer uses to report 
your taxable noncash fringe benefits. Your em-
ployer has the option to report taxable noncash 
fringe benefits by using either of the following 
rules.
•
The general rule: benefits are reported for 
a full calendar year (January 1–December 
31).
•
The special accounting period rule: bene-
fits provided during the last 2 months of the 
calendar year (or any shorter period) are 
treated as paid during the following calen-
dar year. For example, each year your em-
ployer reports the value of benefits provi-
ded during the last 2 months of the prior 
year and the first 10 months of the current 
year.
Your employer doesn’t have to use the same 
accounting period for each fringe benefit, but 
must use the same period for all employees 
who receive a particular benefit.
You must use the same accounting period 
that you use to report the benefit to claim an 
employee business deduction (for use of a car, 
for example).
Form W-2. Your employer must include all tax-
able fringe benefits in box 1 of Form W-2 as wa-
ges, tips, and other compensation and, if appli-
cable, in boxes 3 and 5 as social security and 
Medicare wages. Although not required, your 
employer may include the total value of fringe 
benefits in box 14 (or on a separate statement). 
However, if your employer provided you with a 
vehicle and included 100% of its annual lease 
value in your income, the employer must sepa-
rately report this value to you in box 14 (or on a 
separate statement).
Accident or Health Plan
In most cases, the value of accident or health 
plan coverage provided to you by your em-
ployer isn’t included in your income. Benefits 
you receive from the plan may be taxable, as 
explained later under Sickness and Injury Bene-
fits.
For information on the items covered in this 
section, other than long-term care coverage, 
see Pub. 969, Health Savings Accounts and 
Other Tax-Favored Health Plans.
Long-term care coverage. Contributions by 
your 
employer 
to 
provide 
coverage 
for 
long-term care services generally aren’t inclu-
ded in your income. However, contributions 
made through a flexible spending or similar ar-
rangement offered by your employer must be 
included in your income. This amount will be re-
ported as wages in box 1 of your Form W-2.
Contributions you make to the plan are dis-
cussed in Pub. 502, Medical and Dental Expen-
ses.
Archer MSA contributions. Contributions by 
your employer to your Archer MSA generally 
aren’t included in your income. Their total will 
be reported in box 12 of Form W-2 with code R. 
You must report this amount on Form 8853, 
Archer MSAs and Long-Term Care Insurance 
Contracts. File the form with your return.
Health 
flexible 
spending 
arrangement 
(health FSA). If your employer provides a 
health FSA that qualifies as an accident or 
health plan, the amount of your salary reduc-
tion, and reimbursements of your medical care 
expenses, in most cases, aren’t included in 
your income.
Note. Health FSAs are subject to a limit on 
salary reduction contributions for plan years be-
ginning after 2012. For tax years beginning in 
Page 46 Chapter 5 Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings

2022, the dollar limitation (as indexed for infla-
tion) on voluntary employee salary reductions 
for contributions to health FSAs is $2,850.
Health reimbursement arrangement (HRA). 
If your employer provides an HRA that qualifies 
as an accident or health plan, coverage and re-
imbursements of your medical care expenses 
generally aren’t included in your income.
Health savings account (HSA). If you’re an 
eligible individual, you and any other person, in-
cluding your employer or a family member, can 
make contributions to your HSA. Contributions, 
other than employer contributions, are deducti-
ble on your return whether or not you itemize 
deductions. Contributions made by your em-
ployer aren’t included in your income. Distribu-
tions from your HSA that are used to pay quali-
fied medical expenses aren’t included in your 
income. Distributions not used for qualified 
medical expenses are included in your income. 
See Pub. 969 for the requirements of an HSA.
Contributions by a partnership to a bona fide 
partner's HSA aren’t contributions by an em-
ployer. The contributions are treated as a distri-
bution of money and aren’t included in the part-
ner's 
gross 
income. 
Contributions 
by 
a 
partnership to a partner's HSA for services ren-
dered are treated as guaranteed payments that 
are includible in the partner's gross income. In 
both situations, the partner can deduct the con-
tribution made to the partner's HSA.
Contributions by an S corporation to a 2% 
shareholder-employee's HSA for services ren-
dered are treated as guaranteed payments and 
are includible in the shareholder-employee's 
gross income. The shareholder-employee can 
deduct the contribution made to the share-
holder-employee's HSA.
Qualified HSA funding distribution.  You 
can make a one-time distribution from your indi-
vidual retirement account (IRA) to an HSA and 
you generally won’t include any of the distribu-
tion in your income.
Adoption Assistance
You may be able to exclude from your income 
amounts paid or expenses incurred by your em-
ployer for qualified adoption expenses in con-
nection with your adoption of an eligible child. 
See the Instructions for Form 8839, Qualified 
Adoption Expenses, for more information.
Adoption benefits are reported by your em-
ployer in box 12 of Form W-2 with code T. They 
are also included as social security and Medi-
care wages in boxes 3 and 5. However, they 
aren’t included as wages in box 1. To determine 
the taxable and nontaxable amounts, you must 
complete Part III of Form 8839. File the form 
with your return.
De Minimis (Minimal) Benefits
If your employer provides you with a product or 
service and the cost of it is so small that it would 
be unreasonable for the employer to account 
for it, you generally don’t include its value in 
your income. In most cases, don’t include in 
your income the value of discounts at company 
cafeterias, cab fares home when working over-
time, and company picnics.
Holiday gifts. If your employer gives you a tur-
key, ham, or other item of nominal value at 
Christmas or other holidays, don’t include the 
value of the gift in your income. However, if your 
employer gives you cash or a cash equivalent, 
you must include it in your income.
Educational Assistance
You can exclude from your income up to $5,250 
of qualified employer-provided educational as-
sistance. For more information, see Pub. 970, 
Tax Benefits for Education.
Group-Term Life Insurance
In most cases, the cost of up to $50,000 of 
group-term life insurance coverage provided to 
you by your employer (or former employer) isn’t 
included in your income. However, you must in-
clude in income the cost of employer-provided 
insurance that is more than the cost of $50,000 
of coverage reduced by any amount you pay to-
ward the purchase of the insurance.
For exceptions, see Entire cost excluded 
and Entire cost taxed, later.
If your employer provided more than 
$50,000 of coverage, the amount included in 
your income is reported as part of your wages in 
box 1 of your Form W-2. Also, it’s shown sepa-
rately in box 12 with code C.
Group-term life insurance. This insurance is 
term life insurance protection (insurance for a 
fixed period of time) that:
•
Provides a general death benefit,
•
Is provided to a group of employees,
•
Is provided under a policy carried by the 
employer, and
•
Provides an amount of insurance to each 
employee based on a formula that pre-
vents individual selection.
Permanent benefits. If your group-term life 
insurance policy includes permanent benefits, 
such as a paid-up or cash surrender value, you 
must include in your income, as wages, the cost 
of the permanent benefits minus the amount 
you pay for them. Your employer should be able 
to tell you the amount to include in your income.
Accidental death benefits. Insurance that 
provides accidental or other death benefits but 
doesn’t provide general death benefits (travel 
insurance, for example) isn’t group-term life in-
surance.
Former employer. If your former employer 
provided more than $50,000 of group-term life 
insurance coverage during the year, the amount 
included in your income is reported as wages in 
box 1 of Form W-2. Also, it’s shown separately 
in box 12 with code C. Box 12 will also show the 
amount of uncollected social security and Medi-
care taxes on the excess coverage, with codes 
M and N. You must pay these taxes with your 
income tax return. Include them on Schedule 2 
(Form 1040), line 13.
Two or more employers. Your exclusion for 
employer-provided group-term life insurance 
coverage can’t exceed the cost of $50,000 of 
coverage, whether the insurance is provided by 
a single employer or multiple employers. If two 
or more employers provide insurance coverage 
that totals more than $50,000, the amounts re-
ported as wages on your Forms W-2 won’t be 
correct. You must figure how much to include in 
your income. Reduce the amount you figure by 
any amount reported with code C in box 12 of 
your Forms W-2, add the result to the wages re-
ported in box 1, and report the total on your re-
turn.

Entire cost excluded. You aren’t taxed on the 
cost of group-term life insurance if any of the 
following circumstances apply.
1. You’re permanently and totally disabled 
and have ended your employment.
2. Your employer is the beneficiary of the 
policy for the entire period the insurance is 
in force during the tax year.
3. A charitable organization (defined in Pub. 
526, Charitable Contributions) to which 
contributions are deductible is the only 
beneficiary of the policy for the entire pe-
riod the insurance is in force during the tax 
year. (You aren’t entitled to a deduction for 
a charitable contribution for naming a 
charitable organization as the beneficiary 
of your policy.)
4. The plan existed on January 1, 1984, and:
a. You retired before January 2, 1984, 
and were covered by the plan when 
you retired, or
b. You reached age 55 before January 
2, 1984, and were employed by the 
employer or its predecessor in 1983.
Entire cost taxed. You’re taxed on the entire 
cost of group-term life insurance if either of the 
following circumstances apply.
•
The insurance is provided by your em-
ployer through a qualified employees' trust, 
such as a pension trust or a qualified annu-
ity plan.
•
You're a key employee and your employ-
er's plan discriminates in favor of key em-
ployees.
Retirement Planning Services
Generally, don’t include the value of qualified 
retirement planning services provided to you 
and your spouse by your employer's qualified 
retirement plan. Qualified services include re-
tirement planning advice, information about 
your employer's retirement plan, and informa-
tion about how the plan may fit into your overall 
individual retirement income plan. You can’t ex-
clude the value of any tax preparation, account-
ing, legal, or brokerage services provided by 
your employer.
Transportation
If your employer provides you with a qualified 
transportation fringe benefit, it can be excluded 
from your income, up to certain limits. A quali-
fied transportation fringe benefit is:
•
Transportation in a commuter highway ve-
hicle (such as a van) between your home 
and work place,
•
A transit pass, or
•
Qualified parking.
Cash reimbursement by your employer for 
these expenses under a bona fide reimburse-
ment arrangement is also excludable. However, 
cash reimbursement for a transit pass is exclud-
able only if a voucher or similar item that can be 
exchanged only for a transit pass isn’t readily 
available for direct distribution to you.
Exclusion limit. The exclusion for commuter 
vehicle transportation and transit pass fringe 
benefits can’t be more than $280 a month.
The exclusion for the qualified parking fringe 
benefit can’t be more than $280 a month.
If the benefits have a value that is more than 
these limits, the excess must be included in 
your income.
Commuter highway vehicle. This is a high-
way vehicle that seats at least six adults (not in-
cluding the driver). At least 80% of the vehicle's 
mileage must reasonably be expected to be:
•
For transporting employees between their 
homes and workplace, and
•
On trips during which employees occupy at 
least half of the vehicle's adult seating ca-
pacity (not including the driver).
Transit pass. This is any pass, token, fare-
card, voucher, or similar item entitling a person 
to ride mass transit (whether public or private) 
free or at a reduced rate or to ride in a com-
muter highway vehicle operated by a person in 
the business of transporting persons for com-
pensation.
Qualified parking. This is parking provided to 
an employee at or near the employer's place of 
business. It also includes parking provided on 
or near a location from which the employee 
commutes to work by mass transit, in a com-
muter highway vehicle, or by carpool. It doesn’t 
include parking at or near the employee's 
home.
Retirement Plan 
Contributions
Your employer's contributions to a qualified re-
tirement plan for you aren’t included in income 
at the time contributed. (Your employer can tell 
you whether your retirement plan is qualified.) 
However, the cost of life insurance coverage in-
cluded in the plan may have to be included. See 
Group-Term Life Insurance, earlier, under 
Fringe Benefits.
If your employer pays into a nonqualified 
plan for you, you must generally include the 
contributions in your income as wages for the 
tax year in which the contributions are made. 
However, if your interest in the plan isn’t trans-
ferable or is subject to a substantial risk of for-
feiture (you have a good chance of losing it) at 
the time of the contribution, you don’t have to in-
clude the value of your interest in your income 
until it’s transferable or is no longer subject to a 
substantial risk of forfeiture.
For information on distributions from 
retirement plans, see Pub. 575, Pen-
sion and Annuity Income (or Pub. 721, 
Tax Guide to U.S. Civil Service Retirement Ben-
efits, if you’re a federal employee or retiree).
Elective deferrals. If you’re covered by certain 
kinds of retirement plans, you can choose to 
have part of your compensation contributed by 
your employer to a retirement fund, rather than 
have it paid to you. The amount you set aside 
(called an “elective deferral”) is treated as an 
employer contribution to a qualified plan. An 
elective deferral, other than a designated Roth 
TIP
Page 48 Chapter 5 Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings

contribution (discussed later), isn’t included in 
wages subject to income tax at the time contrib-
uted. Rather, it’s subject to income tax when 
distributed from the plan. However, it’s included 
in wages subject to social security and Medi-
care taxes at the time contributed.
Elective deferrals include elective contribu-
tions to the following retirement plans.
1. Cash or deferred arrangements (section 
401(k) plans).
2. The Thrift Savings Plan for federal em-
ployees.
3. Salary reduction simplified employee pen-
sion plans (SARSEP).
4. Savings incentive match plans for employ-
ees (SIMPLE plans).
5. Tax-sheltered annuity plans (section 
403(b) plans).
6. Section 501(c)(18)(D) plans.
7. Section 457 plans.
Qualified automatic contribution arrange-
ments. Under a qualified automatic contribu-
tion arrangement, your employer can treat you 
as having elected to have a part of your com-
pensation contributed to a section 401(k) plan. 
You are to receive written notice of your rights 
and obligations under the qualified automatic 
contribution arrangement. The notice must ex-
plain:
•
Your rights to elect not to have elective 
contributions made, or to have contribu-
tions made at a different percentage; and
•
How contributions made will be invested in 
the absence of any investment decision by 
you.
You must be given a reasonable period of 
time after receipt of the notice and before the 
first elective contribution is made to make an 
election with respect to the contributions.
Overall limit on deferrals. For 2022, in 
most cases, you shouldn’t have deferred more 
than a total of $20,500 of contributions to the 
plans listed in (1) through (3) and (5) above. 
The limit for SIMPLE plans is $14,000. The limit 
for section 501(c)(18)(D) plans is the lesser of 
$7,000 or 25% of your compensation. The limit 
for section 457 plans is the lesser of your in-
cludible compensation or $20,500. Amounts 
deferred under specific plan limits are part of 
the overall limit on deferrals.
Designated Roth contributions. Employ-
ers with section 401(k) and section 403(b) 
plans can create qualified Roth contribution 
programs so that you may elect to have part or 
all of your elective deferrals to the plan designa-
ted as after-tax Roth contributions. Designated 
Roth contributions are treated as elective defer-
rals, except that they’re included in income at 
the time contributed.
Excess deferrals. Your employer or plan 
administrator should apply the proper annual 
limit when figuring your plan contributions. How-
ever, you’re responsible for monitoring the total 
you defer to ensure that the deferrals aren’t 
more than the overall limit.
If you set aside more than the limit, the ex-
cess must generally be included in your income 
for that year, unless you have an excess defer-
ral of a designated Roth contribution. See Pub. 
525 for a discussion of the tax treatment of ex-
cess deferrals.
Catch-up contributions. You may be al-
lowed catch-up contributions (additional elec-
tive deferral) if you’re age 50 or older by the end 
of the tax year.
Stock Options
If you receive a nonstatutory option to buy or 
sell stock or other property as payment for your 
services, you will usually have income when 
you receive the option, when you exercise the 
option (use it to buy or sell the stock or other 
property), or when you sell or otherwise dispose 
of the option. However, if your option is a statu-
tory stock option, you won’t have any income 
until you sell or exchange your stock. Your em-
ployer can tell you which kind of option you 
hold. For more information, see Pub. 525.
Restricted Property
In most cases, if you receive property for your 
services, you must include its fair market value 
in your income in the year you receive the prop-
erty. However, if you receive stock or other 
property that has certain restrictions that affect 
its value, you don’t include the value of the 
property in your income until it has substantially 
vested. (Although you can elect to include the 
value of the property in your income in the year 
it’s transferred to you.) For more information, 
see Restricted Property in Pub. 525. 
Dividends received on restricted stock. 
Dividends you receive on restricted stock are 
treated as compensation and not as dividend 
income. Your employer should include these 
payments on your Form W-2.
Stock you elected to include in income. 
Dividends you receive on restricted stock you 
elected to include in your income in the year 
transferred are treated the same as any other 
dividends. Report them on your return as divi-
dends. For a discussion of dividends, see Pub. 
550, Investment Income and Expenses.
For information on how to treat dividends re-
ported on both your Form W-2 and Form 
1099-DIV, see Dividends received on restricted 
stock in Pub. 525.
Special Rules for
Certain Employees
This section deals with special rules for people 
in certain types of employment: members of the 
clergy, members of religious orders, people 
working for foreign employers, military person-
nel, and volunteers.
Clergy
Generally, if you’re a member of the clergy, you 
must include in your income offerings and fees 
you receive for marriages, baptisms, funerals, 
masses, etc., in addition to your salary. If the of-
fering is made to the religious institution, it isn’t 
taxable to you.
If you’re a member of a religious organiza-
tion and you give your outside earnings to the 
religious organization, you must still include the 
earnings in your income. However, you may be 
entitled to a charitable contribution deduction 
for the amount paid to the organization. See 
Pub. 526.
Pension. A pension or retirement pay for a 
member of the clergy is usually treated as any 
other pension or annuity. It must be reported on 
lines 5a and 5b of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
Housing. Special rules for housing apply to 
members of the clergy. Under these rules, you 
don’t include in your income the rental value of 
a home (including utilities) or a designated 
housing allowance provided to you as part of 
your pay. However, the exclusion can’t be more 
than the reasonable pay for your services. If you 
pay for the utilities, you can exclude any allow-
ance designated for utility cost, up to your ac-
tual cost. The home or allowance must be provi-
ded as compensation for your services as an 
ordained, licensed, or commissioned minister. 
However, you must include the rental value of 
the home or the housing allowance as earnings 
from self-employment on Schedule SE (Form 
1040) if you’re subject to the self-employment 
tax. For more information, see Pub. 517, Social 
Security and Other Information for Members of 
the Clergy and Religious Workers.
Members of Religious 
Orders
If you’re a member of a religious order who has 
taken a vow of poverty, how you treat earnings 
that you renounce and turn over to the order de-
pends on whether your services are performed 
for the order.
Services performed for the order. If you’re 
performing the services as an agent of the order 
in the exercise of duties required by the order, 
don’t include in your income the amounts 
turned over to the order.
If your order directs you to perform services 
for another agency of the supervising church or 
an associated institution, you’re considered to 
be performing the services as an agent of the 
order. Any wages you earn as an agent of an 
order that you turn over to the order aren’t inclu-
ded in your income.
Example. You’re a member of a church or-
der and have taken a vow of poverty. You re-
nounce any claims to your earnings and turn 
over to the order any salaries or wages you 
earn. You’re a registered nurse, so your order 
assigns you to work in a hospital that is an as-
sociated institution of the church. However, you 
remain under the general direction and control 
of the order. You’re considered to be an agent 
of the order and any wages you earn at the hos-
pital that you turn over to your order aren’t inclu-
ded in your income.
Services performed outside the order. If 
you’re directed to work outside the order, your 
services aren’t an exercise of duties required by 
the order unless they meet both of the following 
requirements.
•
They’re the kind of services that are ordi-
narily the duties of members of the order.
Chapter 5 Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings Page 49

•
They’re part of the duties that you must ex-
ercise for, or on behalf of, the religious or-
der as its agent.
If you’re an employee of a third party, the serv-
ices you perform for the third party won’t be 
considered directed or required of you by the 
order. Amounts you receive for these services 
are included in your income, even if you have 
taken a vow of poverty.
Example. Mark Brown is a member of a re-
ligious order and has taken a vow of poverty. 
He renounces all claims to his earnings and 
turns over his earnings to the order.
Mark is a schoolteacher. He was instructed 
by the superiors of the order to get a job with a 
private tax-exempt school. Mark became an 
employee of the school, and, at his request, the 
school made the salary payments directly to the 
order.
Because Mark is an employee of the school, 
he is performing services for the school rather 
than as an agent of the order. The wages Mark 
earns working for the school are included in his 
income.
Foreign Employer
Special rules apply if you work for a foreign em-
ployer.
U.S. citizen. If you’re a U.S. citizen who works 
in the United States for a foreign government, 
an international organization, a foreign em-
bassy, or any foreign employer, you must in-
clude your salary in your income.
Social security and Medicare taxes. 
You’re exempt from social security and Medi-
care employee taxes if you’re employed in the 
United States by an international organization 
or a foreign government. However, you must 
pay self-employment tax on your earnings from 
services performed in the United States, even 
though you aren’t self-employed. This rule also 
applies if you’re an employee of a qualifying 
wholly owned instrumentality of a foreign gov-
ernment.
Employees of international organizations or 
foreign governments. Your compensation for 
official services to an international organization 
is exempt from federal income tax if you aren’t a 
citizen of the United States or you’re a citizen of 
the Philippines (whether or not you’re a citizen 
of the United States).
Your compensation for official services to a 
foreign government is exempt from federal in-
come tax if all of the following are true.
•
You aren’t a citizen of the United States or 
you’re a citizen of the Philippines (whether 
or not you’re a citizen of the United States).
•
Your work is like the work done by employ-
ees of the United States in foreign coun-
tries.
•
The foreign government gives an equal ex-
emption to employees of the United States 
in its country.
Waiver of alien status. If you’re an alien 
who works for a foreign government or interna-
tional organization and you file a waiver under 
section 247(b) of the Immigration and National-
ity Act to keep your immigrant status, different 
rules may apply. See Foreign Employer in Pub. 
525.
Employment abroad. For information on the 
tax treatment of income earned abroad, see 
Pub. 54.
Military
Payments you receive as a member of a military 
service are generally taxed as wages except for 
retirement pay, which is taxed as a pension. Al-
lowances generally aren’t taxed. For more infor-
mation on the tax treatment of military allowan-
ces and benefits, see Pub. 3, Armed Forces' 
Tax Guide.
Differential wage payments. Any payments 
made to you by an employer during the time 
you’re performing service in the uniformed serv-
ices are treated as compensation. These wages 
are subject to income tax withholding and are 
reported on a Form W-2. See the discussion 
under Miscellaneous Compensation, earlier.
Military retirement pay. If your retirement pay 
is based on age or length of service, it’s taxable 
and must be included in your income as a pen-
sion on lines 5a and 5b of Form 1040 or 
1040-SR. Don’t include in your income the 
amount of any reduction in retirement or re-
tainer pay to provide a survivor annuity for your 
spouse or children under the Retired Service-
man's Family Protection Plan or the Survivor 
Benefit Plan.
For more detailed discussion of survivor an-
nuities, see Pub. 575, Pension and Annuity In-
come.
Disability. If you’re retired on disability, see 
Military and Government Disability Pensions 
under Sickness and Injury Benefits, later.
Veterans' benefits. Don’t include in your in-
come any veterans' benefits paid under any 
law, regulation, or administrative practice ad-
ministered by the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs (VA). The following amounts paid to veter-
ans or their families aren’t taxable.
•
Education, training, and subsistence allow-
ances.
•
Disability compensation and pension pay-
ments for disabilities paid either to veter-
ans or their families.
•
Grants for homes designed for wheelchair 
living.
•
Grants for motor vehicles for veterans who 
lost their sight or the use of their limbs.
•
Veterans' insurance proceeds and divi-
dends paid either to veterans or their bene-
ficiaries, including the proceeds of a veter-
an's endowment policy paid before death.
•
Interest on insurance dividends you leave 
on deposit with the VA.
•
Benefits under a dependent-care assis-
tance program.
•
The death gratuity paid to a survivor of a 
member of the Armed Forces who died af-
ter September 10, 2001.
•
Payments made under the compensated 
work therapy program.
•
Any bonus payment by a state or political 
subdivision because of service in a combat 
zone.
Volunteers
The tax treatment of amounts you receive as a 
volunteer worker for the Peace Corps or similar 
agency is covered in the following discussions.
Peace Corps. Living allowances you receive 
as a Peace Corps volunteer or volunteer leader 
for housing, utilities, household supplies, food, 
and clothing are generally exempt from tax.
Taxable allowances. The following allow-
ances, however, must be included in your in-
come and reported as wages.
•
Allowances paid to your spouse and minor 
children while you’re a volunteer leader 
training in the United States.
•
Living allowances designated by the Direc-
tor of the Peace Corps as basic compen-
sation. These are allowances for personal 
items such as domestic help, laundry and 
clothing maintenance, entertainment and 
recreation, transportation, and other mis-
cellaneous expenses.
•
Leave allowances.
•
Readjustment allowances or termination 
payments. These are considered received 
by you when credited to your account.
Example. Gary Carpenter, a Peace Corps 
volunteer, gets $175 a month as a readjustment 
allowance during his period of service, to be 
paid to him in a lump sum at the end of his tour 
of duty. Although the allowance isn’t available 
to him until the end of his service, Gary must in-
clude it in his income on a monthly basis as it’s 
credited to his account.
Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA). If 
you’re a VISTA volunteer, you must include 
meal and lodging allowances paid to you in 
your income as wages.
National Senior Services Corps programs. 
Don’t include in your income amounts you re-
ceive for supportive services or reimburse-
ments for out-of-pocket expenses from the fol-
lowing programs.
•
Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP).
•
Foster Grandparent Program.
•
Senior Companion Program. 
Service 
Corps 
of 
Retired 
Executives 
(SCORE). If you receive amounts for suppor-
tive 
services 
or 
reimbursements 
for 
out-of-pocket expenses from SCORE, don’t in-
clude these amounts in gross income.
Volunteer tax counseling. Don’t include in 
your income any reimbursements you receive 
for transportation, meals, and other expenses 
you have in training for, or actually providing, 
volunteer federal income tax counseling for the 
elderly (TCE).
You can deduct as a charitable contribution 
your unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses in 
taking part in the volunteer income tax assis-
tance (VITA) program. See Pub. 526.
Page 50 Chapter 5 Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings

Volunteer firefighters and emergency medi-
cal responders.  If you are a volunteer fire-
fighter or emergency medical responder, don’t 
include in your income the following benefits 
you receive from a state or local government.
•
Rebates or reductions of property or in-
come taxes you receive because of serv-
ices you performed as a volunteer fire-
fighter or emergency medical responder.
•
Payments you receive because of services 
you performed as a volunteer firefighter or 
emergency medical responder, up to $50 
for each month you provided services.
The excluded income reduces any related tax 
or contribution deduction.
Sickness and Injury 
Benefits
This section discusses sickness and injury ben-
efits, including disability pensions, long-term 
care insurance contracts, workers' compensa-
tion, and other benefits.
In most cases, you must report as income 
any amount you receive for personal injury or 
sickness through an accident or health plan that 
is paid for by your employer. If both you and 
your employer pay for the plan, only the amount 
you receive that is due to your employer's pay-
ments is reported as income. However, certain 
payments may not be taxable to you. For infor-
mation on nontaxable payments, see Military 
and Government Disability Pensions and Other 
Sickness and Injury Benefits, later in this dis-
cussion.
Don’t report as income any amounts 
paid to reimburse you for medical ex-
penses you incurred after the plan was 
established.
Cost paid by you. If you pay the entire cost of 
a health or accident insurance plan, don’t in-
clude any amounts you receive from the plan 
for personal injury or sickness as income on 
your tax return. If your plan reimbursed you for 
medical expenses you deducted in an earlier 
year, you may have to include some, or all, of 
the reimbursement in your income. See What if 
You Receive Insurance Reimbursement in a 
Later Year? in Pub. 502, Medical and Dental 
Expenses.
Cafeteria plans. In most cases, if you’re cov-
ered by an accident or health insurance plan 
through a cafeteria plan, and the amount of the 
insurance premiums wasn’t included in your in-
come, you aren’t considered to have paid the 
premiums and you must include any benefits 
you receive in your income. If the amount of the 
premiums was included in your income, you’re 
considered to have paid the premiums, and any 
benefits you receive aren’t taxable.
Disability Pensions
If you retired on disability, you must include in 
income any disability pension you receive under 
a plan that is paid for by your employer. You 
must report your taxable disability payments as 
wages on line 1a of Form 1040 or 1040-SR until 
you reach minimum retirement age. Minimum 
TIP
retirement age is generally the age at which you 
can first receive a pension or annuity if you’re 
not disabled.
You may be entitled to a tax credit if 
you were permanently and totally disa-
bled when you retired. For information 
on this credit and the definition of permanent 
and total disability, see Pub. 524, Credit for the 
Elderly or the Disabled.
Beginning on the day after you reach mini-
mum retirement age, payments you receive are 
taxable as a pension or annuity. Report the pay-
ments on lines 5a and 5b of Form 1040 or 
1040-SR. The rules for reporting pensions are 
explained in Disability Pensions in Pub. 575.
For information on disability payments from 
a governmental program provided as a substi-
tute for unemployment compensation, see Un-
employment Benefits in chapter 8.
Retirement and profit-sharing plans. If you 
receive 
payments 
from 
a 
retirement 
or 
profit-sharing plan that doesn’t provide for disa-
bility retirement, don’t treat the payments as a 
disability pension. The payments must be re-
ported as a pension or annuity. For more infor-
mation on pensions, see Pub. 575.
Accrued leave payment. If you retire on disa-
bility, any lump-sum payment you receive for 
accrued annual leave is a salary payment. The 
payment is not a disability payment. Include it in 
your income in the tax year you receive it.
Military and Government
Disability Pensions
Certain military and government disability pen-
sions aren’t taxable.
Service-connected disability. You may be 
able to exclude from income amounts you re-
ceive as a pension, annuity, or similar allow-
ance for personal injury or sickness resulting 
from active service in one of the following gov-
ernment services.
•
The armed forces of any country.
•
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration.
•
The Public Health Service.
•
The Foreign Service.
Conditions for exclusion. Don’t include 
the disability payments in your income if any of 
the following conditions apply.
1. You were entitled to receive a disability 
payment before September 25, 1975.
2. You were a member of a listed govern-
ment service or its reserve component, or 
were under a binding written commitment 
to become a member, on September 24, 
1975.
3. You receive the disability payments for a 
combat-related injury. This is a personal 
injury or sickness that:
a. Results directly from armed conflict;
b. Takes place while you’re engaged in 
extra-hazardous service;
c. Takes place under conditions simulat-
ing war, including training exercises 
such as maneuvers; or
TIP
d. Is caused by an instrumentality of war.
4. You would be entitled to receive disability 
compensation from the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs (VA) if you filed an applica-
tion for it. Your exclusion under this condi-
tion is equal to the amount you would be 
entitled to receive from the VA.
Pension based on years of service. If you 
receive a disability pension based on years of 
service, in most cases you must include it in 
your income. However, if the pension qualifies 
for the exclusion for a service-connected disa-
bility (discussed earlier), don’t include in income 
the part of your pension that you would have re-
ceived if the pension had been based on a per-
centage of disability. You must include the rest 
of your pension in your income.
Retroactive VA determination. If you retire 
from the armed services based on years of 
service and are later given a retroactive serv-
ice-connected disability rating by the VA, your 
retirement pay for the retroactive period is ex-
cluded from income up to the amount of VA dis-
ability benefits you would have been entitled to 
receive. You can claim a refund of any tax paid 
on the excludable amount (subject to the stat-
ute of limitations) by filing an amended return 
on Form 1040-X for each previous year during 
the retroactive period. You must include with 
each Form 1040-X a copy of the official VA De-
termination letter granting the retroactive bene-
fit. The letter must show the amount withheld 
and the effective date of the benefit.
If you receive a lump-sum disability sever-
ance payment and are later awarded VA disa-
bility benefits, exclude 100% of the severance 
benefit from your income. However, you must 
include in your income any lump-sum readjust-
ment or other nondisability severance payment 
you received on release from active duty, even 
if you’re later given a retroactive disability rating 
by the VA.
Special period of limitation. In most ca-
ses, under the period of limitation, a claim for 
credit or refund must be filed within 3 years 
from the time a return was filed or 2 years from 
the time the tax was paid. However, if you re-
ceive a retroactive service-connected disability 
rating determination, the period of limitation is 
extended by a 1-year period beginning on the 
date of the determination. This 1-year extended 
period applies to claims for credit or refund filed 
after June 17, 2008, and doesn’t apply to any 
tax year that began more than 5 years before 
the date of the determination.
Terrorist attack or military action. Don’t in-
clude in your income disability payments you 
receive for injuries incurred as a direct result of 
a terrorist attack directed against the United 
States (or its allies), whether outside or within 
the United States or from military action. See 
Pub. 3920 and Pub. 907 for more information.
Long-Term Care
Insurance Contracts
Long-term care insurance contracts in most ca-
ses are treated as accident and health insur-
ance contracts. Amounts you receive from them 
(other than policyholder dividends or premium 
Chapter 5 Wages, Salaries, and Other Earnings Page 51

refunds) in most cases are excludable from in-
come as amounts received for personal injury 
or sickness. To claim an exclusion for payments 
made on a per diem or other periodic basis un-
der a long-term care insurance contract, you 
must file Form 8853 with your return.
A long-term care insurance contract is an in-
surance contract that only provides coverage 
for qualified long-term care services. The con-
tract must:
•
Be guaranteed renewable;
•
Not provide for a cash surrender value or 
other money that can be paid, assigned, 
pledged, or borrowed;
•
Provide that refunds, other than refunds on 
the death of the insured or complete sur-
render or cancellation of the contract, and 
dividends under the contract, may only be 
used to reduce future premiums or in-
crease future benefits; and
•
In most cases, not pay or reimburse ex-
penses incurred for services or items that 
would be reimbursed under Medicare, ex-
cept where Medicare is a secondary payer 
or the contract makes per diem or other 
periodic payments without regard to ex-
penses.
Qualified long-term care services. Qualified 
long-term care services are:
•
Necessary diagnostic, preventive, thera-
peutic, curing, treating, mitigating, and re-
habilitative services, and maintenance and 
personal care services; and
•
Required by a chronically ill individual and 
provided pursuant to a plan of care prescri-
bed by a licensed health care practitioner.
Chronically ill individual. A chronically ill indi-
vidual is one who has been certified by a li-
censed health care practitioner within the previ-
ous 12 months as one of the following.
•
An individual who, for at least 90 days, is 
unable to perform at least two activities of 
daily living without substantial assistance 
due to loss of functional capacity. Activities 
of daily living are eating, toileting, transfer-
ring, bathing, dressing, and continence.
•
An individual who requires substantial su-
pervision to be protected from threats to 
health and safety due to severe cognitive 
impairment.
Limit on exclusion. You can generally ex-
clude from gross income up to $390 a day for 
2022. See Limit on exclusion, under Long-Term 
Care Insurance Contracts, under Sickness and 
Injury Benefits in Pub. 525 for more information.
Workers' Compensation
Amounts you receive as workers' compensation 
for an occupational sickness or injury are fully 
exempt from tax if they’re paid under a workers' 
compensation act or a statute in the nature of a 
workers' compensation act. The exemption also 
applies to your survivors. The exemption, how-
ever, doesn’t apply to retirement plan benefits 
you receive based on your age, length of serv-
ice, or prior contributions to the plan, even if you 
retired because of an occupational sickness or 
injury.
If part of your workers' compensation 
reduces your social security or equiva-
lent railroad retirement benefits re-
ceived, that part is considered social security 
(or equivalent railroad retirement) benefits and 
may be taxable. For more information, see Pub. 
915, Social Security and Equivalent Railroad 
Retirement Benefits.
Return to work. If you return to work after 
qualifying for workers' compensation, salary 
payments you receive for performing light du-
ties are taxable as wages.
Other Sickness and Injury 
Benefits
In addition to disability pensions and annuities, 
you may receive other payments for sickness or 
injury.
Railroad sick pay. Payments you receive as 
sick pay under the Railroad Unemployment In-
surance Act are taxable and you must include 
them in your income. However, don’t include 
them in your income if they’re for an on-the-job 
injury.
If you received income because of a disabil-
ity, see Disability Pensions, earlier.
Federal 
Employees' 
Compensation 
Act 
(FECA). Payments received under this Act for 
personal injury or sickness, including payments 
to beneficiaries in case of death, aren’t taxable. 
However, you’re taxed on amounts you receive 
under this Act as continuation of pay for up to 
45 days while a claim is being decided. Report 
this income as wages. Also, pay for sick leave 
while a claim is being processed is taxable and 
must be included in your income as wages.
If part of the payments you receive un-
der FECA reduces your social security 
or equivalent railroad retirement bene-
fits received, that part is considered social se-
curity (or equivalent railroad retirement) benefits 
and may be taxable. See Pub. 554 for more in-
formation.
Other compensation. Many other amounts 
you receive as compensation for sickness or in-
jury aren’t taxable. These include the following 
amounts.
•
Compensatory damages you receive for 
physical injury or physical sickness, 
whether paid in a lump sum or in periodic 
payments.
•
Benefits you receive under an accident or 
health insurance policy on which either you 
paid the premiums or your employer paid 
the premiums but you had to include them 
in your income.
•
Disability benefits you receive for loss of 
income or earning capacity as a result of 
injuries under a no-fault car insurance pol-
icy.
•
Compensation you receive for permanent 
loss or loss of use of a part or function of 
your body, or for your permanent disfigure-
ment. This compensation must be based 
only on the injury and not on the period of 
your absence from work. These benefits 
aren’t taxable even if your employer pays

for the accident and health plan that pro-
vides these benefits.
Reimbursement for medical care. A reim-
bursement for medical care is generally not tax-
able. However, it may reduce your medical ex-
pense deduction. For more information, see 
Pub. 502.

Interest Income
Reminders
Foreign-source income. If you are a U.S. citi-
zen with interest income from sources outside 
the United States (foreign income), you must re-
port that income on your tax return unless it is 
exempt by U.S. law. This is true whether you re-
side inside or outside the United States and 
whether or not you receive a Form 1099 from 
the foreign payer.
 
Automatic 6-month extension. If you receive 
your Form 1099 reporting your interest income 
late and you need more time to file your tax re-
turn, you can request a 6-month extension of 
time to file. See Automatic Extension in chap-
ter 1.
 
Children who have unearned income. See 
Form 8615 and its instructions for the rules and 
rates that apply to certain children with un-
earned income.
Introduction
This chapter discusses the following topics.
•
Different types of interest income.
•
What interest is taxable and what interest 
is nontaxable.
•
When to report interest income.
•
How to report interest income on your tax 
return.
In general, any interest you receive or that is 
credited to your account and can be withdrawn 
is taxable income. Exceptions to this rule are 
discussed later in this chapter.
You may be able to deduct expenses you 
have in earning this income on Schedule A 
(Form 1040) if you itemize your deductions. See 
Money borrowed to invest in certificate of de-
posit, later, and chapter 12.

General Information
A few items of general interest are covered 
here.
Recordkeeping. You should keep a 
list showing sources of interest income 
and interest amounts received during 
the year. Also, keep the forms you receive 
showing your interest income (Forms 1099-INT, 
for example) as an important part of your re-
cords.
Tax on unearned income of certain chil-
dren. Part of a child's 2022 unearned income 
may be taxed at the parent's tax rate. If so, 
Form 8615 must be completed and attached to 
the child's tax return. If not, Form 8615 isn't re-
quired and the child's income is taxed at his or 
her own tax rate.
Some parents can choose to include the 
child's interest and dividends on the parent's re-
turn. If you can, use Form 8814 for this purpose.
For more information about the tax on un-
earned income of children and the parents' 
election, go to Form 8615.
Beneficiary of an estate or trust. Interest 
you receive as a beneficiary of an estate or trust 
is generally taxable income. You should receive 
a Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), Beneficiary's 
Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc., 
from the fiduciary. Your copy of Schedule K-1 
(Form 1041) and its instructions will tell you 
where to report the income on your Form 1040 
or 1040-SR.
Taxpayer identification number (TIN). You 
must give your name and TIN (either a social 
security number (SSN), an employer identifica-
tion number (EIN), an adoption taxpayer identi-
fication number (ATIN), or an individual tax 
identification number (ITIN)) to any person re-
quired by federal tax law to make a return, 
statement, or other document that relates to 
you. This includes payers of interest. If you 
don't give your TIN to the payer of interest, the 
payer will generally be required to backup with-
hold on the interest payments at a rate of 24%, 
and you may also be subject to a penalty.

RECORDS
TIN for joint account. If the funds in a joint 
account belong to one person, list that person's 
name first on the account and give that person's 
TIN to the payer. (For information on who owns 
the funds in a joint account, see Joint accounts, 
later.) If the joint account contains combined 
funds, give the TIN of the person whose name 
is listed first on the account. This is because 
only one name and TIN can be shown on Form 
1099.
These rules apply to both joint ownership by 
a married couple and to joint ownership by 
other individuals. For example, if you open a 
joint savings account with your child using 
funds belonging to the child, list the child's 
name first on the account and give the child's 
TIN.
Custodian account for your child. If your 
child is the actual owner of an account that is 
recorded in your name as custodian for the 
child, give the child's TIN to the payer. For ex-
ample, you must give your child's SSN to the 
payer of interest on an account owned by your 
child, even though the interest is paid to you as 
custodian.
Penalty for failure to supply TIN. If you 
don't give your TIN to the payer of interest, you 
may have to pay a penalty. See Failure to sup-
ply SSN under Penalties in chapter 1. Backup 
withholding may also apply.
Backup withholding. Your interest income is 
generally not subject to regular withholding. 
However, it may be subject to backup withhold-
ing to ensure that income tax is collected on the 
income. Under backup withholding, the payer of 
interest must withhold, as income tax, on the 
amount you are paid, by applying the appropri-
ate withholding rate. The current rate is 24%. 
Withholding is required only if there is a condi-
tion for backup withholding, such as failing to 
provide your TIN to the payer or failing to certify 
your TIN under penalties of perjury, if required.
Backup withholding may also be required if 
the IRS has determined that you underreported 
your interest or dividend income. For more in-
formation, see Backup Withholding in chap-
ter 4.
Reporting backup withholding. If backup 
withholding is deducted from your interest in-
come, the amount withheld will be reported on 
your Form 1099-INT. The Form 1099-INT will 
show any backup withholding as “Federal in-
come tax withheld.”
Joint accounts. If two or more persons hold 
property (such as a savings account or bond) 
as joint tenants, tenants by the entirety, or ten-
ants in common, each person's share of any in-
terest from the property is determined by local 
law.
Income from property given to a child. 
Property you give as a parent to your child un-
der the Model Gifts of Securities to Minors Act, 
the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, or any similar 
law becomes the child's property.
Income from the property is taxable to the 
child, except that any part used to satisfy a legal 
obligation to support the child is taxable to the 
parent or guardian having that legal obligation.
Savings account with parent as trustee. 
Interest income from a savings account opened 
for a minor child, but placed in the name and 
subject to the order of the parents as trustees, 
is taxable to the child if, under the law of the 
state in which the child resides, both of the fol-
lowing are true.
•
The savings account legally belongs to the 
child.
•
The parents aren't legally permitted to use 
any of the funds to support the child.
Form 1099-INT. Interest income is generally 
reported to you on Form 1099-INT, or a similar 
statement, by banks, savings and loans, and 
other payers of interest. This form shows you 
the interest income you received during the 
year. Keep this form for your records. You don't 
have to attach it to your tax return.
Report on your tax return the total interest 
income you receive for the tax year. See the 
Form 1099-INT Instructions for Recipient to see 
whether you need to adjust any of the amounts 
reported to you.
Interest not reported on Form 1099-INT. 
Even if you don't receive a Form 1099-INT, you 
must still report all of your interest income. For 
example, you may receive distributive shares of 
interest from partnerships or S corporations. 
This interest is reported to you on Schedule K-1 
(Form 1065), Partner's Share of Income, De-
duction, Credits, etc.; or Schedule K-1 (Form 
1120-S), Shareholder's Share of Income, De-
ductions, Credits, etc.
Nominees. Generally, if someone receives 
interest as a nominee for you, that person must 
give you a Form 1099-INT showing the interest 
received on your behalf.
If you receive a Form 1099-INT that includes 
amounts belonging to another person, see the 
discussion on nominee distributions under How 
To Report Interest Income in chapter 1 of 
IRS.gov/Pub550, or the Schedule B (Form 
1040) instructions.
Incorrect amount. If you receive a Form 
1099-INT that shows an incorrect amount or 
other incorrect information, you should ask the 
issuer for a corrected form. The new Form 
1099-INT you receive will have the “CORREC-
TED” box checked.
Form 1099-OID. Reportable interest income 
may also be shown on Form 1099-OID, Original 
Issue Discount. For more information about 
amounts shown on this form, see Original Issue 
Discount (OID), later in this chapter.
The box references discussed below 
are from the January 2022 revisions of 
Form 1099-INT and Form 1099-DIV. 
Later revisions may have different box referen-
ces.
Exempt-interest dividends. Exempt-interest 
dividends you receive from a mutual fund or 
other regulated investment company (RIC) 
aren't included in your taxable income. (How-
ever, see Information reporting requirement 
next.) Exempt-interest dividends should be 
shown on Form 1099-DIV, box 12. You don't re-
duce your basis for distributions that are ex-
empt-interest dividends.
Information reporting requirement. Al-
though

taxable, you must show them on your tax return 
if you have to file. This is an information report-
ing requirement and doesn't change the ex-
empt-interest dividends into taxable income.
Note. Exempt-interest dividends paid by a 
mutual fund or other RIC on specified private 
activity bonds may be subject to the alternative 
minimum tax. This amount is generally reported 
in box 13 of Form 1099-DIV. See Alternative 
Minimum Tax (AMT) in chapter 13 for more in-
formation. Chapter 1 of IRS.gov/Pub550 con-
tains a discussion on private activity bonds un-
der State or Local Government Obligations.
Interest on VA dividends. Interest on insur-
ance dividends left on deposit with the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs (VA) isn't taxable. This 
includes interest paid on dividends on conver-
ted United States Government Life Insurance 
and on National Service Life Insurance policies.
Individual retirement arrangements (IRAs). 
Interest on a Roth IRA generally isn't taxable. 
Interest on a traditional IRA is tax deferred. You 
generally don't include interest earned in an IRA 
in your income until you make withdrawals from 
the IRA. See chapter 9.
Taxable Interest
Taxable interest includes interest you receive 
from bank accounts, loans you make to others, 
and other sources. The following are some 
sources of taxable interest.
Dividends that are actually interest. Certain 
distributions commonly called dividends are ac-
tually interest. You must report as interest 
so-called dividends on deposits or on share ac-
counts in:
•
Cooperative banks,
•
Credit unions,
•
Domestic building and loan associations,
•
Domestic savings and loan associations,
•
Federal savings and loan associations, 
and
•
Mutual savings banks.
The “dividends” will be shown as interest in-
come on Form 1099-INT.
Money market funds. Money market funds 
pay dividends and are offered by nonbank fi-
nancial institutions, such as mutual funds and 
stock brokerage houses. Generally, amounts 
you receive from money market funds should 
be reported as dividends, not as interest.
Certificates of deposit and other deferred 
interest accounts. If you open any of these 
accounts, interest may be paid at fixed intervals 
of 1 year or less during the term of the account. 
You must generally include this interest in your 
income when you actually receive it or are enti-
tled to receive it without paying a substantial 
penalty. The same is true for accounts that ma-
ture in 1 year or less and pay interest in a single 
payment at maturity. If interest is deferred for 
more than 1 year, see Original Issue Discount 
(OID), later.
Interest subject to penalty for early with-
drawal. If you withdraw funds from a deferred 
interest account before maturity, you may have 
to pay a penalty. You must report the total 
amount of interest paid or credited to your ac-
count during the year, without subtracting the 
penalty. See Penalty on early withdrawal of sav-
ings in chapter 1 of IRS.gov/Pub550 for more 
information on how to report the interest and 
deduct the penalty.
Money borrowed to invest in certificate 
of deposit. The interest you pay on money 
borrowed from a bank or savings institution to 
meet the minimum deposit required for a certifi-
cate of deposit from the institution and the inter-
est you earn on the certificate are two separate 
items. You must report the total interest income 
you earn on the certificate in your income. If you 
itemize deductions, you can deduct the interest 
you pay as investment interest, up to the 
amount of your net investment income. See In-
terest Expenses in chapter 3 of IRS.gov/
Pub550.
Example. You deposited $5,000 with a 
bank and borrowed $5,000 from the bank to 
make up the $10,000 minimum deposit required 
to buy a 6-month certificate of deposit. The cer-
tificate earned $575 at maturity in 2022, but you 
received only $265, which represented the 
$575 you earned minus $310 interest charged 
on your $5,000 loan. The bank gives you a 
Form 1099-INT for 2022 showing the $575 in-
terest you earned. The bank also gives you a 
statement showing that you paid $310 of inter-
est for 2022. You must include the $575 in your 
income. If you itemize your deductions on 
Schedule A (Form 1040), you can deduct $310, 
subject to the net investment income limit.
Gift for opening account. If you receive non-
cash gifts or services for making deposits or for 
opening an account in a savings institution, you 
may have to report the value as interest.
For deposits of less than $5,000, gifts or 
services valued at more than $10 must be re-
ported as interest. For deposits of $5,000 or 
more, gifts or services valued at more than $20 
must be reported as interest. The value is deter-
mined by the cost to the financial institution.
Example. You open a savings account at 
your local bank and deposit $800. The account 
earns $20 interest. You also receive a $15 cal-
culator. If no other interest is credited to your 
account during the year, the Form 1099-INT 
you receive will show $35 interest for the year. 
You must report $35 interest income on your tax 
return.
Interest on insurance dividends. Interest on 
insurance dividends left on deposit with an in-
surance company that can be withdrawn annu-
ally is taxable to you in the year it is credited to 
your account. However, if you can withdraw it 
only on the anniversary date of the policy (or 
other specified date), the interest is taxable in 
the year that date occurs.
Prepaid insurance premiums. Any increase 
in the value of prepaid insurance premiums, ad-
vance premiums, or premium deposit funds is 
interest if it is applied to the payment of premi-
ums due on insurance policies or made availa-
ble for you to withdraw.
U.S. obligations. Interest on U.S. obligations 
issued by any agency or instrumentality of the 
United States, such as U.S. Treasury bills, 
notes, and bonds, is taxable for federal income 
tax purposes.
Interest on tax refunds. Interest you receive 
on tax refunds is taxable income.
Interest on condemnation award. If the con-
demning authority pays you interest to compen-
sate you for a delay in payment of an award, the 
interest is taxable.
Installment sale payments. If a contract for 
the sale or exchange of property provides for 
deferred payments, it also usually provides for 
interest payable with the deferred payments. 
Generally, that interest is taxable when you re-
ceive it. If little or no interest is provided for in a 
deferred payment contract, part of each pay-
ment may be treated as interest. See Unstated 
Interest and Original Issue Discount in Pub. 
537, Installment Sales.
Interest on annuity contract. Accumulated 
interest on an annuity contract you sell before 
its maturity date is taxable.
Usurious interest. Usurious interest is interest 
charged at an illegal rate. This is taxable as in-
terest unless state law automatically changes it 
to a payment on the principal.
Interest income on frozen deposits. Ex-
clude from your gross income interest on frozen 
deposits. A deposit is frozen if, at the end of the 
year, you can't withdraw any part of the deposit 
because:
•
The financial institution is bankrupt or in-
solvent, or
•
The state where the institution is located 
has placed limits on withdrawals because 
other financial institutions in the state are 
bankrupt or insolvent.
The amount of interest you must exclude is 
the interest that was credited on the frozen de-
posits minus the sum of:
•
The net amount you withdrew from these 
deposits during the year, and
•
The amount you could have withdrawn as 
of the end of the year (not reduced by any 
penalty for premature withdrawals of a time 
deposit).
If you receive a Form 1099-INT for interest in-
come on deposits that were frozen at the end of 
2022, see Frozen deposits under How To Re-
port Interest Income in chapter 1 of IRS.gov/
Pub550 for information about reporting this in-
terest income exclusion on your tax return.
The interest you exclude is treated as credi-
ted to your account in the following year. You 
must include it in income in the year you can 
withdraw it.
Example. $100 of interest was credited on 
your frozen deposit during the year. You with-
drew $80 but couldn't withdraw any more as of 
the end of the year. You must include $80 in 
your income and exclude $20 from your income 
for the year. You must include the $20 in your 
income for the year you can withdraw it.
Bonds traded flat. If you buy a bond at a dis-
count when interest has been defaulted or 
when the interest has accrued but hasn't been 
paid, the transaction is described as trading a 
Page 54 Chapter 6 Interest Income

bond flat. The defaulted or unpaid interest isn't 
income and isn't taxable as interest if paid later. 
When you receive a payment of that interest, it 
is a return of capital that reduces the remaining 
cost basis of your bond. Interest that accrues 
after the date of purchase, however, is taxable 
interest income for the year it is received or ac-
crued. See Bonds Sold Between Interest Dates, 
later, for more information.
Below-market loans. In general, a below-mar-
ket loan is a loan on which no interest is 
charged or on which interest is charged at a 
rate below the applicable federal rate. If you are 
the lender of a below-market loan, you may 
have additional interest income. See Be-
low-Market Loans in chapter 1 of IRS.gov/
Pub550 for more information.
U.S. Savings Bonds
This section provides tax information on U.S. 
savings bonds. It explains how to report the in-
terest income on these bonds and how to treat 
transfers of these bonds.
For other information on U.S. savings 
bonds, write to:
Treasury Retail Securities Services
P.O. Box 9150
Minneapolis, MN 55480-9150
Or,

the 
Internet, 
visit 
TreasuryDirect.gov/savings-bonds/.
Accrual method taxpayers. If you use an ac-
crual method of accounting, you must report in-
terest on U.S. savings bonds each year as it ac-
crues. You can't postpone reporting interest 
until you receive it or until the bonds mature. 
Accrual methods of accounting are explained in 
chapter 1 under Accounting Methods.
Cash method taxpayers. If you use the cash 
method of accounting, as most individual tax-
payers do, you generally report the interest on 
U.S. savings bonds when you receive it. The 
cash method of accounting is explained in 
chapter 1 under Accounting Methods. But see 
Reporting options for cash method taxpayers, 
later.
Series H and HH bonds. These bonds were 
issued at face value in exchange for other sav-
ings bonds. Series HH bonds were issued be-
tween 1980 and 2004. They mature 20 years 
after issue. Series HH bonds that have not ma-
tured pay interest twice a year (usually by direct 
deposit to your bank account). If you are a cash 
method taxpayer, you must report this interest 
as income in the year you receive it.
Most H/HH bonds have a deferred interest 
component. The reporting of this as income is 
addressed later in this chapter.
Series H bonds were issued before 1980. All 
Series H bonds have matured and are no lon-
ger earning interest.
Series EE and Series I bonds. Interest on 
these bonds is payable when you redeem the 
bonds. The difference between the purchase 
price and the redemption value is taxable inter-
est.
Series E and EE bonds. Series E bonds 
were issued before July of 1980. All Series E 
bonds have matured and are no longer earning 
interest. Series EE bonds were first offered in 
January 1980 and have a maturity period of 30 
years; they were offered in paper (definitive) 
form until 2012. Paper Series EE and Series E 
bonds were issued at a discount and increase 
in value as they earn interest. Electronic 
(book-entry) Series EE bonds were first offered 
in 2003; they are issued at face value and in-
crease in value as they earn interest. For all 
Series E and Series EE bonds, the purchase 
price plus all accrued interest is payable to you 
at redemption.
Series I bonds. Series I bonds were first of-
fered in 1998. These are inflation-indexed 
bonds issued at face value with a maturity pe-
riod of 30 years. Series I bonds increase in 
value as they earn interest. The face value plus 
all accrued interest is payable to you at redemp-
tion.
Reporting options for cash method tax-
payers. If you use the cash method of report-
ing income, you can report the interest on Ser-
ies EE and Series I bonds in either of the 
following ways.
1. Method 1. Postpone reporting the interest 
until the earlier of the year you cash or dis-
pose of the bonds or the year they mature. 
(However, see Savings bonds traded, 
later.)
Note. Series EE bonds issued in 1992 
matured in 2022. If you used method 1, 
you must generally report the interest on 
these bonds on your 2022 return.
2. Method 2. Choose to report the increase 
in redemption value as interest each year.
You must use the same method for all Series 
EE, Series E, and Series I bonds you own. If 
you don't choose method 2 by reporting the in-
crease in redemption value as interest each 
year, you must use method 1.
If you plan to cash your bonds in the 
same year you will pay for higher edu-
cation expenses, you may want to use 
method 1 because you may be able to exclude 
the interest from your income. To learn how, 
see Education Savings Bond Program, later.
Change from method 1. If you want to 
change your method of reporting the interest 
from method 1 to method 2, you can do so with-
out permission from the IRS. In the year of 
change, you must report all interest accrued to 
date and not previously reported for all your 
bonds.
Once you choose to report the interest each 
year, you must continue to do so for all Series 
EE and Series I bonds you own and for any you 
get later, unless you request permission to 
change, as explained next.
Change from method 2. To change from 
method 2 to method 1, you must request per-
mission from the IRS. Permission for the 
change is automatically granted if you send the 
IRS a statement that meets all the following re-
quirements.
1. You have typed or printed the following 
number at the top: “131.”
TIP
2. It includes your name and social security 
number under “131.”
3. It includes the year of change (both the 
beginning and ending dates).
4. It identifies the savings bonds for which 
you are requesting this change.
5. It includes your agreement to:
a. Report all interest on any bonds ac-
quired during or after the year of 
change when the interest is realized 
upon disposition, redemption, or final 
maturity, whichever is earliest; and
b. Report all interest on the bonds ac-
quired before the year of change 
when the interest is realized upon dis-
position, redemption, or final maturity, 
whichever is earliest, with the excep-
tion of the interest reported in prior tax 
years.
You must attach this statement to your tax 
return for the year of change, which you must 
file by the due date (including extensions).
You can have an automatic extension of 6 
months from the due date of your return for the 
year of change (excluding extensions) to file the 
statement with an amended return. On the 
statement, type or print “Filed pursuant to sec-
tion 301.9100-2.” To get this extension, you 
must have filed your original return for the year 
of the change by the due date (including exten-
sions).
Instead of filing this statement, you can re-
quest permission to change from method 2 to 
method 1 by filing Form 3115, Application for 
Change in Accounting Method. In that case, fol-
low the form instructions for an automatic 
change. No user fee is required.
Co-owners. If a U.S. savings bond is issued in 
the names of co-owners, such as you and your 
child or you and your spouse, interest on the 
bond is generally taxable to the co-owner who 
bought the bond.
One co-owner's funds used. If you used 
your funds to buy the bond, you must pay the 
tax on the interest. This is true even if you let 
the other co-owner redeem the bond and keep 
all the proceeds. Under these circumstances, 
the co-owner who redeemed the bond will re-
ceive a Form 1099-INT at the time of redemp-
tion and must provide you with another Form 
1099-INT showing the amount of interest from 
the bond taxable to you. The co-owner who re-
deemed the bond is a “nominee.” See Nominee 
distributions under How To Report Interest In-
come in chapter 1 of IRS.gov/Pub550 for more 
information about how a person who is a nomi-
nee reports interest income belonging to an-
other person.
Both co-owners' funds used. If you and 
the other co-owner each contribute part of the 
bond's purchase price, the interest is generally 
taxable to each of you, in proportion to the 
amount each of you paid.
Community property. If you and your 
spouse live in a community property state and 
hold bonds as community property, one-half of 
the interest is considered received by each of 
you. If you file separate returns, each of you 
must generally report one-half of the bond 
Chapter 6 Interest Income Page 55

interest. For more information about community 
property, see Pub. 555.
Table 6-1. These rules are also shown in 
Table 6-1.
Ownership transferred. If you bought Series 
EE or Series I bonds entirely with your own 
funds and had them reissued in your co-owner's 
name or beneficiary's name alone, you must in-
clude in your gross income for the year of reis-
sue all interest that you earned on these bonds 
and have not previously reported. But, if the 
bonds were reissued in your name alone, you 
don't have to report the interest accrued at that 
time.
This same rule applies when bonds (other 
than bonds held as community property) are 
transferred between spouses or incident to di-
vorce.
Purchased jointly. If you and a co-owner 
each contributed funds to buy Series EE or Ser-
ies I bonds jointly and later have the bonds reis-
sued in the co-owner's name alone, you must 
include in your gross income for the year of reis-
sue your share of all the interest earned on the 
bonds that you have not previously reported. 
The former co-owner doesn't have to include in 
gross income at the time of reissue his or her 
share of the interest earned that was not repor-
ted before the transfer. This interest, however, 
as well as all interest earned after the reissue, is 
income to the former co-owner.
This income-reporting rule also applies 
when a new co-owner purchases your share of 
the bond and the bonds are reissued in the 
name of your former co-owner and a new 
co-owner. But the new co-owner will report only 
his or her share of the interest earned after the 
transfer.
If bonds that you and a co-owner bought 
jointly are reissued to each of you separately in 
the same proportion as your contribution to the 
purchase price, neither you nor your co-owner 
has to report at that time the interest earned be-
fore the bonds were reissued.
Example 1. You and your spouse each 
spent an equal amount to buy a $1,000 Series 
EE savings bond. The bond was issued to you 
and your spouse as co-owners. You both post-
pone reporting interest on the bond. You later 
have the bond reissued as two $500 bonds, 
one in your name and one in your spouse's 
name. At that time, neither you nor your spouse 
has to report the interest earned to the date of 
reissue.
Example 2. You bought a $1,000 Series 
EE savings bond entirely with your own funds. 
The bond was issued to you and your spouse 
as co-owners. You both postpone reporting in-
terest on the bond. You later have the bond 
reissued as two $500 bonds, one in your name 
and one in your spouse's name. You must re-
port half the interest earned to the date of reis-
sue.
Transfer to a trust. If you own Series EE or 
Series I bonds and transfer them to a trust, giv-
ing up all rights of ownership, you must include 
in your income for that year the interest earned 
to the date of transfer if you have not already re-
ported it. However, if you are considered the 
owner of the trust and if the increase in value 
both before and after the transfer continues to 
be taxable to you, you can continue to defer re-
porting the interest earned each year. You must 
include the total interest in your income in the 
year you cash or dispose of the bonds or the 
year the bonds finally mature, whichever is ear-
lier.
The same rules apply to previously unrepor-
ted interest on Series EE or Series E bonds if 
the transfer to a trust consisted of Series HH 
bonds you acquired in a trade for the Series EE 
or Series E bonds. See Savings bonds traded, 
later.
Decedents. The manner of reporting interest 
income on Series EE or Series I bonds, after 
the death of the owner (decedent), depends on 
the accounting and income-reporting methods 
previously used by the decedent. This is ex-
plained in chapter 1 of IRS.gov/Pub550.
Savings bonds traded. Prior to September 
2004, you could trade (exchange) Series E or 
EE bonds for Series H or HH bonds. At the time 
of the trade, you had the choice to postpone 
(defer) reporting the interest earned on your 
Series E or EE bonds until the Series H or HH 
bonds received in the trade were redeemed or 
matured. Any cash you received in the transac-
tion was income up to the amount of the interest 
that had accrued on the Series E or EE bonds. 
The amount of income that you chose to post-
pone reporting was recorded on the face of the 
Series H or HH bonds as “Deferred Interest”; 
this amount is also equal to the difference be-
tween the redemption value of the Series H or 
HH bonds and your cost. Your cost is the sum 
of the amount you paid for the exchanged Ser-
ies E or EE bonds plus any amount you had to 
pay at the time of the transaction.
Example. You traded Series EE bonds (on 
which you postponed reporting the interest) for 
$2,500 in Series HH bonds and $223 in cash. 
You reported the $223 as taxable income on 
your tax return. At the time of the trade, the Ser-
ies EE bonds had accrued interest of $523 and 
a redemption value of $2,723. You hold the Ser-
ies HH bonds until maturity, when you receive 
$2,500. You must report $300 as interest in-
come in the year of maturity. This is the differ-
ence between their redemption value, $2,500, 
and your cost, $2,200 (the amount you paid for 
the Series EE bonds). It is also the difference 
between the accrued interest of $523 on the 
Series EE bonds and the $223 cash received 
on the trade.
Note. The $300 amount that is reportable 
upon redemption or maturity may be found re-
corded on the face of the Series HH bond as 
“Deferred Interest.” If more than one Series HH 
bond is received in the exchange, the total 
amount of interest postponed/deferred in the 
transaction is divided proportionately among 
the Series HH bonds.
Choice to report interest in year of trade. 
You can choose to treat all of the previously un-
reported accrued interest on the Series E or EE 
bonds traded for Series H or HH bonds as in-
come in the year of the trade. If you choose to 
report the interest, then the “Deferred Interest” 
notation on the face of the Series H or HH 
bonds received in the trade will be $0 or blank.
Form 1099-INT for U.S. savings bonds inter-
est. When you cash a bond, the bank or other 
payer that redeems it must give you a Form 
1099-INT if the interest part of the payment you 
receive is $10 or more. Box 3 of your Form 
1099-INT should show the interest as the differ-
ence between the amount you received and the 
amount paid for the bond. However, your Form 
1099-INT may show more interest than you 
have to include on your income tax return. For 
example, this may happen if any of the following 
are true.
•
You chose to report the increase in the re-
demption value of the bond each year. The 
interest shown on your Form 1099-INT 
won't be reduced by amounts previously 
included in income.
•
You received the bond from a decedent. 
The interest shown on your Form 1099-INT 
won't be reduced by any interest reported 
by the decedent before death, or on the 
decedent's final return, or by the estate on 
the estate's income tax return.
•
Ownership of the bond was transferred. 
The interest shown on your Form 1099-INT 
won't be reduced by interest that accrued 
before the transfer.
Note. This is true for paper bonds, but 
the Treasury reporting process for elec-
tronic bonds is more refined—if Treasury is 
aware that the transfer of an electronic 
savings bond is a reportable event, then 
the transferor will receive a Form 1099-INT 
for the year of the transfer for the interest 
accrued up to the time of the transfer; 
when the transferee later disposes of the 
bond (redemption, maturity, or further 
transfer), the transferee will receive a Form 
1099-INT reduced by the amount reported 
to the transferor at the time of the original 
transfer.
•
You were named as a co-owner, and the 
other co-owner contributed funds to buy 
the bond. The interest shown on your Form 
1099-INT won't be reduced by the amount 
you received as nominee for the other 
co-owner. (See Co-owners, earlier in this 
chapter, for more information about the re-
porting requirements.)
Table 6-1. Who Pays the Tax on U.S. Savings Bond Interest
IF...
THEN the interest must be reported by...

the person for whom you bought the bond.
you and another person buy a bond as co-owners, each 
contributing part of the purchase price
both you and the other co-owner, in proportion to the 
amount each paid for the bond.
you and your spouse, who live in a community property 
state, buy a bond that is community property
you and your spouse. If you file separate returns, both you 
and your spouse generally report one-half of the interest.
Page 56 Chapter 6 Interest Income

•
You received the bond in a taxable distri-
bution from a retirement or profit-sharing 
plan. The interest shown on your Form 
1099-INT won't be reduced by the interest 
portion of the amount taxable as a distribu-
tion from the plan and not taxable as inter-
est. (This amount is generally shown on 
Form 1099-R, Distributions From Pen-
sions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Shar-
ing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc., 
for the year of distribution.)
For more information on including the cor-
rect amount of interest on your return, see How 
To Report Interest Income, later. Pub. 550 in-
cludes examples showing how to report these 
amounts.
Interest on U.S. savings bonds is ex-
empt from state and local taxes. The 
Form 1099-INT you receive will indi-
cate the amount that is for U.S. savings bond in-
terest in box 3.
Education Savings Bond 
Program
You may be able to exclude from income all or 
part of the interest you receive on the redemp-
tion of qualified U.S. savings bonds during the 
year if you pay qualified higher educational ex-
penses during the same year. This exclusion is 
known as the Education Savings Bond Pro-
gram.
You don't qualify for this exclusion if your fil-
ing status is married filing separately.
Form 8815. Use Form 8815 to figure your 
exclusion. Attach the form to your Form 1040 or 
1040-SR.
Qualified U.S. savings bonds. A qualified 
U.S. savings bond is a Series EE bond issued 
after 1989 or a Series I bond. The bond must be 
issued either in your name (sole owner) or in 
your and your spouse's names (co-owners). 
You must be at least 24 years old before the 
bond's issue date. For example, a bond bought 
by a parent and issued in the name of his or her 
child under age 24 doesn't qualify for the exclu-
sion by the parent or child.
The issue date of a bond may be ear-
lier than the date the bond is pur-
chased because the issue date as-
signed to a bond is the first day of the month in 
which it is purchased.
Beneficiary. You can designate any individual 
(including a child) as a beneficiary of the bond.
Verification by IRS. If you claim the exclu-
sion, the IRS will check it by using bond re-
demption information from the Department of 
the Treasury.
Qualified expenses. Qualified higher edu-
cation expenses are tuition and fees required 
for you, your spouse, or your dependent (for 
whom you claim an exemption) to attend an eli-
gible educational institution.
Qualified expenses include any contribution 
you make to a qualified tuition program or to a 
Coverdell education savings account (ESA).
Qualified expenses don't include expenses 
for room and board or for courses involving 
TIP
CAUTION
!
sports, games, or hobbies that aren't part of a 
degree- or certificate-granting program.
Eligible educational institutions. These 
institutions include most public, private, and 
nonprofit universities, colleges, and vocational 
schools that are accredited and eligible to par-
ticipate in student aid programs run by the U.S. 
Department of Education.
Reduction for certain benefits. You must 
reduce your qualified higher education expen-
ses by all of the following tax-free benefits.
1. Tax-free part of scholarships and fellow-
ships (see Scholarships and fellowships in 
chapter 8).
2. Expenses used to figure the tax-free por-
tion of distributions from a Coverdell ESA.
3. Expenses used to figure the tax-free por-
tion of distributions from a qualified tuition 
program.
4. Any tax-free payments (other than gifts or 
inheritances) received for educational ex-
penses, such as:
a. Veterans' educational assistance ben-
efits,
b. Qualified tuition reductions, or
c. Employer-provided educational assis-
tance.
5. Any expense used in figuring the Ameri-
can opportunity and lifetime learning cred-
its.
Amount excludable. If the total proceeds 
(interest and principal) from the qualified U.S. 
savings bonds you redeem during the year 
aren't more than your adjusted qualified higher 
education expenses for the year, you may be 
able to exclude all of the interest. If the pro-
ceeds are more than the expenses, you may be 
able to exclude only part of the interest.
To determine the excludable amount, multi-
ply the interest part of the proceeds by a frac-
tion. The numerator of the fraction is the quali-
fied higher education expenses you paid during 
the year. The denominator of the fraction is the 
total proceeds you received during the year.
Example. In February 2022, Mark and 
Joan, a married couple, cashed qualified Series 
EE U.S. savings bonds with a total denomina-
tion of $10,000 that they bought in April 2006 
for $5,000. They received proceeds of $8,264, 
representing principal of $5,000 and interest of 
$3,264. In 2022, they paid $4,000 of their 
daughter's college tuition. They aren't claiming 
an education credit for that amount, and their 
daughter doesn't have any tax-free educational 
assistance. They can exclude $1,580 ($3,264 × 
($4,000 ÷ $8,264)) of interest in 2022. They 
must include the remaining $1,684 ($3,264 − 
$1,580) interest in gross income.
Modified adjusted gross income limit. 
The interest exclusion is limited if your modified 
adjusted gross income (modified AGI) is:
•
$128,650 to $158,650 for married taxpay-
ers filing jointly, and
•
$85,800 to $100,800 for all other taxpay-
ers.
You don't qualify for the interest exclusion if 
your modified AGI is equal to or more than the 
upper limit for your filing status.
Modified AGI, for purposes of this exclusion, 
is adjusted gross income (Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, line 11) figured before the interest ex-
clusion, and modified by adding back any:
1. Foreign earned income exclusion,
2. Foreign housing exclusion and deduction,
3. Exclusion of income for bona fide resi-
dents of American Samoa,
4. Exclusion for income from Puerto Rico,
5. Exclusion for adoption benefits received 
under an employer's adoption assistance 
program, and
6. Deduction for student loan interest.
Use the Line 9 Worksheet in the Form 8815 
instructions to figure your modified AGI.
If you have investment interest expense in-
curred to earn royalties and other investment in-
come, see Education Savings Bond Program in 
chapter 1 of IRS.gov/Pub550.
Recordkeeping. If you claim the inter-
est exclusion, you must keep a written 
record of the qualified U.S. savings 
bonds you redeem. Your record must include 
the serial number, issue date, face value, and 
total redemption proceeds (principal and inter-
est) of each bond. You can use Form 8818 to 
record this information. You should also keep 
bills, receipts, canceled checks, or other docu-
mentation that shows you paid qualified higher 
education expenses during the year.
U.S. Treasury Bills,
Notes, and Bonds
Treasury bills, notes, and bonds are direct 
debts (obligations) of the U.S. Government.
Taxation of interest. Interest income from 
Treasury bills, notes, and bonds is subject to 
federal income tax but is exempt from all state 
and local income taxes. You should receive a 
Form 1099-INT showing the interest paid to you 
for the year in box 3.
Treasury bills. These bills generally have a 
4-week, 8-week, 13-week, 26-week, or 52-week 
maturity period. They are generally issued at a 
discount in the amount of $100 and multiples of 
$100. The difference between the discounted 
price you pay for the bills and the face value 
you receive at maturity is interest income. Gen-
erally, you report this interest income when the 
bill is paid at maturity. If you paid a premium for 
a bill (more than the face value), you generally 
report the premium as a section 171 deduction 
when the bill is paid at maturity.
Treasury 
notes 
and 
bonds. Treasury 
notes generally have maturity periods of more 
than 1 year, ranging up to 10 years. Maturity pe-
riods for Treasury bonds are generally longer 
than 10 years. Both are generally issued in de-
nominations of $100 to $1,000,000 and gener-
ally pay interest every 6 months. Generally, you 
report this interest for the year paid. For more 
information, see U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, and 
Bonds in chapter 1 of IRS.gov/Pub550.

Treasury inflation-protected securities 
(TIPS). These securities pay interest twice a 
year at a fixed rate, based on a principal 
amount adjusted to take into account inflation 
and deflation. For the tax treatment of these se-
curities, see Inflation-Indexed Debt Instruments 
under Original Issue Discount (OID) in IRS.gov/
Pub550.
Bonds Sold Between
Interest Dates
If you sell a bond between interest payment 
dates, part of the sales price represents interest 
accrued to the date of sale. You must report 
that part of the sales price as interest income for 
the year of sale.
If you buy a bond between interest payment 
dates, part of the purchase price represents in-
terest accrued before the date of purchase. 
When that interest is paid to you, treat it as a 
nontaxable return of your capital investment, 
rather than as interest income. See Accrued in-
terest on bonds under How To Report Interest 
Income in chapter 1 of IRS.gov/Pub550 for in-
formation on reporting the payment.
Insurance
Life insurance proceeds paid to you as benefi-
ciary of the insured person are usually not taxa-
ble. But if you receive the proceeds in install-
ments, you must usually report a part of each 
installment payment as interest income.
For more information about insurance pro-
ceeds received in installments, see Pub. 525, 
Taxable and Nontaxable Income.
Annuity. If you buy an annuity with life insur-
ance proceeds, the annuity payments you re-
ceive are taxed as pension and annuity income 
from a nonqualified plan, not as interest in-
come. See chapter 5 for information on pension 
and annuity income from nonqualified plans.
State or Local
Government Obligations
Interest on a bond used to finance government 
operations generally isn't taxable if the bond is 
issued by a state, the District of Columbia, a 
possession of the United States, or any of their 
political subdivisions.
Bonds issued after 1982 by an Indian tribal 
government (including tribal economic develop-
ment bonds issued after February 17, 2009) are 
treated as issued by a state. Interest on these 
bonds is generally tax exempt if the bonds are 
part of an issue of which substantially all pro-
ceeds are to be used in the exercise of any es-
sential government function. However, the es-
sential government function requirement does 
not apply to tribal economic development 
bonds issued after February 17, 2009. See sec-
tion 7871(f).
For information on federally guaranteed 
bonds, mortgage revenue bonds, arbitrage 
bonds, private activity bonds, qualified tax 
credit bonds, and Build America bonds, includ-
ing whether interest on some of these bonds is 
taxable, see State or Local Government Obliga-
tions in chapter 1 of IRS.gov/Pub550.
Information reporting requirement. If you 
file a tax return, you are required to show any 
tax-exempt interest you received on your return. 
Tax-exempt interest paid to you will be reported 
to you on Form 1099-INT, box 8. This is an in-
formation reporting requirement only. It doesn't 
change tax-exempt interest to taxable interest.
Original Issue Discount 
(OID)
Original issue discount (OID) is a form of inter-
est. You generally include OID in your income 
as it accrues over the term of the debt instru-
ment, whether or not you receive any payments 
from the issuer.
A debt instrument generally has OID when 
the instrument is issued for a price that is less 
than its stated redemption price at maturity. OID 
is the difference between the stated redemption 
price at maturity and the issue price.
All debt instruments that pay no interest be-
fore maturity are presumed to be issued at a 
discount. Zero coupon bonds are one example 
of these instruments.
The OID accrual rules generally don't apply 
to short-term obligations (those with a fixed ma-
turity date of 1 year or less from date of issue). 
See Discount on Short-Term Obligations in 
chapter 1 of IRS.gov/Pub550.
De minimis OID. You can treat the discount as 
zero if it is less than one-fourth of 1% (0.0025) 
of the stated redemption price at maturity multi-
plied by the number of full years from the date 
of original issue to maturity. This small discount 
is known as de minimis OID.
Example 1. You bought a 10-year bond 
with a stated redemption price at maturity of 
$1,000, issued at $980 with OID of $20. 
One-fourth of 1% of $1,000 (stated redemption 
price) times 10 (the number of full years from 
the date of original issue to maturity) equals 
$25. Because the $20 discount is less than $25, 
the OID is treated as zero. (If you hold the bond 
at maturity, you will recognize $20 ($1,000 − 
$980) of capital gain.)
Example 2. The facts are the same as in 
Example 1, except that the bond was issued at 
$950. The OID is $50. Because the $50 dis-
count is more than the $25 figured in Exam-
ple 1, you must include the OID in income as it 
accrues over the term of the bond.
Debt instrument bought after original is-
sue. If you buy a debt instrument with de mini-
mis OID at a premium, the de minimis OID isn't 
includible in income. If you buy a debt instru-
ment with de minimis OID at a discount, the dis-
count is reported under the market discount 
rules. See Market Discount Bonds in chapter 1 
of IRS.gov/Pub550.
Exceptions to reporting OID as current in-
come. The OID rules discussed in this chapter 
don't apply to the following debt instruments.
1. Tax-exempt obligations. (However, see 
Stripped tax-exempt obligations under 
Stripped Bonds and Coupons in chapter 1 
of IRS.gov/Pub550.)
2. U.S. savings bonds.
3. Short-term debt instruments (those with a 
fixed maturity date of not more than 1 year 
from the date of issue).
4. Loans between individuals if all the follow-
ing are true.
a. The loan is not made in the course of 
a trade or business of the lender.
b. The amount of the loan, plus the 
amount of any outstanding prior loans 
between the same individuals, is 
$10,000 or less.
c. Avoiding any federal tax isn't one of 
the principal purposes of the loan.
5. A debt instrument purchased at a pre-
mium.
Form 1099-OID. The issuer of the debt instru-
ment (or your broker if you held the instrument 
through a broker) should give you Form 
1099-OID, or a similar statement, if the total 
OID for the calendar year is $10 or more. Form 
1099-OID will show, in box 1, the amount of 
OID for the part of the year that you held the 
bond. It will also show, in box 2, the stated inter-
est you must include in your income. Box 8 
shows OID on a U.S. Treasury obligation for the 
part of the year you owned it and isn't included 
in box 1. A copy of Form 1099-OID will be sent 
to the IRS. Don't file your copy with your return. 
Keep it for your records.
In most cases, you must report the entire 
amount in boxes 1, 2, and 8 of Form 1099-OID 
as interest income. But see Refiguring OID 
shown on Form 1099-OID, later in this discus-
sion, for more information.
Form 1099-OID not received. If you had OID 
for the year but didn't receive a Form 1099-OID, 
you may have to figure the correct amount of 
OID to report on your return. See Pub. 1212 for 
details on how to figure the correct OID.
Nominee. If someone else is the holder of 
record (the registered owner) of an OID instru-
ment belonging to you and receives a Form 
1099-OID on your behalf, that person must give 
you a Form 1099-OID.
Refiguring OID shown on Form 1099-OID. 
You may need to refigure the OID shown in 
box 1 or box 8 of Form 1099-OID if either of the 
following applies.
•
You bought the debt instrument after its 
original issue and paid a premium or an ac-
quisition premium.
Page 58 Chapter 6 Interest Income

•
The debt instrument is a stripped bond or a 
stripped coupon (including certain zero 
coupon instruments).
If you acquired your debt instrument before 
2014, your payer is only required to report a 
gross amount of OID in box 1 or box 8 of Form 
1099-OID.
For information about figuring the correct 
amount of OID to include in your income, see 
Figuring OID on Long-Term Debt Instruments in 
Pub. 1212 and the Form 1099-OID Instructions 
for Recipient.
If you acquired your debt instrument after 
2013, unless you have informed your payer that 
you do not want to amortize bond premium, 
your payer must generally report either (1) a net 
amount of OID that reflects the offset of OID by 
the amount of bond premium or acquisition pre-
mium amortization for the year, or (2) a gross 
amount for both the OID and the bond premium 
or acquisition premium amortization for the 
year.
Refiguring periodic interest shown on Form 
1099-OID. If you disposed of a debt instrument 
or acquired it from another holder during the 
year, see Bonds Sold Between Interest Dates, 
earlier, for information about the treatment of 
periodic interest that may be shown in box 2 of 
Form 1099-OID for that instrument.
Certificates of deposit (CDs). If you buy a 
CD with a maturity of more than 1 year, you 
must include in income each year a part of the 
total interest due and report it in the same man-
ner as other OID.
This also applies to similar deposit arrange-
ments with banks, building and loan associa-
tions, etc., including:
•
Time deposits,
•
Bonus plans,
•
Savings certificates,
•
Deferred income certificates,
•
Bonus savings certificates, and
•
Growth savings certificates.
Bearer CDs. CDs issued after 1982 must 
generally be in registered form. Bearer CDs are 
CDs not in registered form. They aren't issued 
in the depositor's name and are transferable 
from one individual to another.
Banks must provide the IRS and the person 
redeeming a bearer CD with a Form 1099-INT.
More information. See chapter 1 of IRS.gov/
Pub550 for more information about OID and re-
lated topics, such as market discount bonds.
When To Report 
Interest Income
When to report your interest income depends 
on whether you use the cash method or an ac-
crual method to report income.
Cash method. Most individual taxpayers use 
the cash method. If you use this method, you 
generally report your interest income in the year 
in which you actually or constructively receive it. 
However, there are special rules for reporting 
the discount on certain debt instruments. See 
U.S. Savings Bonds and Original Issue Dis-
count (OID), earlier.
Example. On September 1, 2020, you 
loaned another individual $2,000 at 4% interest, 
compounded annually. You aren't in the busi-
ness of lending money. The note stated that 
principal and interest would be due on August 
31, 2022. In 2022, you received $2,163.20 
($2,000 principal and $163.20 interest). If you 
use the cash method, you must include in in-
come on your 2022 return the $163.20 interest 
you received in that year.
Constructive receipt. You constructively 
receive income when it is credited to your ac-
count or made available to you. You don't need 
to have physical possession of it. For example, 
you are considered to receive interest, divi-
dends, or other earnings on any deposit or ac-
count in a bank, savings and loan, or similar fi-
nancial institution, or interest on life insurance 
policy dividends left to accumulate, when they 
are credited to your account and subject to your 
withdrawal.
You constructively receive income on the 
deposit or account even if you must:
•
Make withdrawals in multiples of even 
amounts;
•
Give a notice to withdraw before making 
the withdrawal;
•
Withdraw all or part of the account to with-
draw the earnings; or
•
Pay a penalty on early withdrawals, unless 
the interest you are to receive on an early 
withdrawal or redemption is substantially 
less than the interest payable at maturity.
Accrual method. If you use an accrual 
method, you report your interest income when 
you earn it, whether or not you have received it. 
Interest is earned over the term of the debt in-
strument.
Example. If, in the previous example, you 
use an accrual method, you must include the in-
terest in your income as you earn it. You would 
report the interest as follows: 2020, $26.67; 
2021, $81.06; and 2022, $55.47.
Coupon bonds. Interest on bearer bonds with 
detachable coupons is generally taxable in the 
year the coupon becomes due and payable. It 
doesn't matter when you mail the coupon for 
payment.
How To Report
Interest Income
Generally, you report all your taxable interest in-
come on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 2b.
Schedule B (Form 1040). You must also 
complete Schedule B (Form 1040), Part I, if you 
file Form 1040 or 1040-SR and any of the fol-
lowing apply.
1. Your taxable interest income is more than 
$1,500.
2. You are claiming the interest exclusion un-
der the Education Savings Bond Program 
(discussed earlier).
3. You received interest from a seller-fi-
nanced mortgage, and the buyer used the 
property as a home.
4. You received a Form 1099-INT for U.S. 
savings bond interest that includes 
amounts you reported in a previous tax 
year.
5. You received, as a nominee, interest that 
actually belongs to someone else.
6. You received a Form 1099-INT for interest 
on frozen deposits.
7. You received a Form 1099-INT for interest 
on a bond you bought between interest 
payment dates.
8. You are reporting OID in an amount less 
than the amount shown on Form 
1099-OID.
9. You reduce interest income from bonds by 
amortizable bond premium.
In Part I, line 1, list each payer's name and the 
amount received from each. If you received a 
Form 1099-INT or Form 1099-OID from a bro-
kerage firm, list the brokerage firm as the payer.
The box references discussed below 
are from the January 2022 revisions of 
Form 1099-INT and Form 1099-DIV. 
Later revisions may have different box referen-
ces.
Reporting tax-exempt interest. Total your 
tax-exempt interest (such as interest or accrued 
OID on certain state and municipal bonds, in-
cluding zero coupon municipal bonds) reported 
on Form 1099-INT, box 8, Form 1099-OID, 
box 11, and exempt-interest dividends from a 
mutual fund or other regulated investment com-
pany reported on Form 1099-DIV, box 12. Add 
these amounts to any other tax-exempt interest 
you received. Report the total on line 2a of 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
Form 1099-INT, box 9, and Form 1099-DIV, 
box 13, show the tax-exempt interest subject to 
the alternative minimum tax on Form 6251. 
These amounts are already included in the 
amounts on Form 1099-INT, box 8, and Form 
1099-DIV, box 12. Don't add the amounts in 
Form 1099-INT, box 9, and Form 1099-DIV, 
box 13, to, or subtract them from, the amounts 
on Form 1099-INT, box 8, and Form 1099-DIV, 
box 12.
Don't report interest from an IRA as 
tax-exempt interest.
Form 1099-INT. Your taxable interest income, 
except for interest from U.S. savings bonds and 
Treasury obligations, is shown in box 1 of Form 
1099-INT. Add this amount to any other taxable 
interest income you received. See the Form 
1099-INT Instructions for Recipient if you have 
interest from a security acquired at a premium. 
You must report all of your taxable interest in-
come even if you don't receive a Form 
1099-INT. Contact your financial institution if 
you don't receive a Form 1099-INT by February 
15. Your identifying number may be truncated 
on any Form 1099-INT you receive.
If you forfeited interest income because of 
the early withdrawal of a time deposit, the de-
ductible amount will be shown on Form

1099-INT in box 2. See Penalty on early with-
drawal of savings in chapter 1 of IRS.gov/
Pub550.
Box 3 of Form 1099-INT shows the interest 
income you received from U.S. savings bonds, 
Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury 
bonds. Generally, add the amount shown in 
box 3 to any other taxable interest income you 
received. If part of the amount shown in box 3 
was previously included in your interest income, 
see U.S. savings bond interest previously re-
ported, later. If you acquired the security at a 
premium, see the Form 1099-INT Instructions 
for Recipient.
Box 4 of Form 1099-INT will contain an 
amount if you were subject to backup withhold-
ing. Include the amount from box 4 on Form 
1040 or 1040-SR, line 25b (federal income tax 
withheld).
Box 5 of Form 1099-INT shows investment 
expenses. This amount is not deductible. See 
chapter 12 for more information about invest-
ment expenses.
Box 6 of Form 1099-INT shows foreign tax 
paid. You may be able to claim this tax as a de-
duction or a credit on your Form 1040 or 
1040-SR. See your tax return instructions.
Box 7 of Form 1099-INT shows the country 
or U.S. possession to which the foreign tax was 
paid.
U.S. savings bond interest previously re-
ported. If you received a Form 1099-INT for 
U.S. savings bond interest, the form may show 
interest you don't have to report. See Form 
1099-INT for U.S. savings bonds interest, ear-
lier.
On Schedule B (Form 1040), Part I, line 1, 
report all the interest shown on your Form 
1099-INT. Then follow these steps.
1. Several rows above line 2, enter a subtotal 
of all interest listed on line 1.
2. Below the subtotal, enter “U.S. Savings 
Bond Interest Previously Reported” and 
enter amounts previously reported or inter-
est accrued before you received the bond.
3. Subtract these amounts from the subtotal 
and enter the result on line 2.

Introduction
This chapter explains the federal income tax 
rules for social security benefits and equivalent 
tier 1 railroad retirement benefits. It explains the 
following topics.
•
How to figure whether your benefits are 
taxable.
•
How to report your taxable benefits.
•
How to use the Social Security Benefits 
Worksheet (with examples).
•
Deductions related to your benefits and 
how to treat repayments that are more than 
the benefits you received during the year.
Social security benefits include monthly re-
tirement, survivor, and disability benefits. They 
don’t include Supplemental Security Income 
(SSI) payments, which aren’t taxable.
Equivalent tier 1 railroad retirement benefits 
are the part of tier 1 benefits that a railroad em-
ployee or beneficiary would have been entitled 
to receive under the social security system. 
They are commonly called the social security 
equivalent benefit (SSEB) portion of tier 1 bene-
fits. 
If you received these benefits during 2022, 
you should have received a Form SSA-1099, 
Social Security Benefit Statement; or Form 
RRB-1099, Payments by the Railroad Retire-
ment Board. These forms show the amounts re-
ceived and repaid, and taxes withheld for the 
year. You may receive more than one of these 
forms for the same year. You should add the 
amounts shown on all the Forms SSA-1099 and 
Forms RRB-1099 you receive for the year to 
determine the total amounts received and re-
paid, and taxes withheld for that year. See the 
Appendix at the end of Pub. 915 for more infor-
mation.
Note. When the term “benefits” is used in 
this chapter, it applies to both social security 
benefits and the SSEB portion of tier 1 railroad 
retirement benefits.
my Social Security account. Social security 
beneficiaries may quickly and easily obtain in-
formation from the SSA's website with a my So-
cial Security account to:
•
Keep track of your earnings and verify 
them every year,
•
Get an estimate of your future benefits if 
you are still working,
•
Get a letter with proof of your benefits if 
you currently receive them,
•
Change your address,
•
Start or change your direct deposit,
•
Get a replacement Medicare card, and
•
Get a replacement Form SSA-1099 for the 
tax season.
For more information and to set up an account, 
go to SSA.gov/myaccount.
What isn’t covered in this chapter. This 
chapter doesn’t cover the tax rules for the fol-
lowing railroad retirement benefits.
•
Non-social security equivalent benefit 
(NSSEB) portion of tier 1 benefits.
•
Tier 2 benefits.
•
Vested dual benefits.
•
Supplemental annuity benefits.
For information on these benefits, see Pub. 
575, Pension and Annuity Income.
This chapter doesn’t cover the tax rules for 
social security benefits reported on Form 
SSA-1042S, Social Security Benefit Statement; 
or Form RRB-1042S, Statement for Nonresi-
dent Alien Recipients of Payments by the Rail-
road Retirement Board. For information about 
these benefits, see Pub. 519, U.S. Tax Guide 
for Aliens; and Pub. 915.
This chapter also doesn’t cover the tax rules 
for foreign social security benefits. These bene-
fits are taxable as annuities, unless they are ex-
empt from U.S. tax or treated as a U.S. social 
security benefit under a tax treaty.

Are Any of Your 
Benefits Taxable?
To find out whether any of your benefits may be 
taxable, compare the base amount (explained 
later) for your filing status with the total of:
1. One-half of your benefits; plus
2. All your other income, including tax-ex-
empt interest.
Exclusions. When making this comparison, 
don’t reduce your other income by any exclu-
sions for:
•
Interest from qualified U.S. savings bonds,
•
Employer-provided adoption benefits,
•
Interest on education loans,
•
Foreign earned income or foreign housing, 
or
•
Income earned by bona fide residents of 
American Samoa or Puerto Rico.
Children's benefits. The rules in this chapter 
apply to benefits received by children. See Who 
is taxed, later.
Figuring total income. To figure the total of 
one-half of your benefits plus your other in-
come, use Worksheet 7-1, discussed later. If 
the total is more than your base amount, part of 
your benefits may be taxable.
If you are married and file a joint return for 
2022, you and your spouse must combine your 
incomes and your benefits to figure whether any 
of your combined benefits are taxable. Even if 
your spouse didn’t receive any benefits, you 
must add your spouse's income to yours to fig-
ure whether any of your benefits are taxable.

retirement benefits, your benefits generally 
aren’t taxable and you probably don’t have to 
file a return. If you have income in addition to 
your benefits, you may have to file a return even 
if none of your benefits are taxable. See Do I 
Have To File a Return? in chapter 1, earlier; 
Pub. 501; or your tax return instructions to find 
out if you have to file a return.
Base amount. Your base amount is:
•
$25,000 if you are single, head of house-
hold, or qualifying surviving spouse;
•
$25,000 if you are married filing separately 
and lived apart from your spouse for all of 
2022;
•
$32,000 if you are married filing jointly; or
•
$0 if you are married filing separately and 
lived with your spouse at any time during 
2022.
Worksheet 7-1. You can use Worksheet 7-1 to 
figure the amount of income to compare with 
your base amount. This is a quick way to check 
whether some of your benefits may be taxable.
Worksheet 7-1. A Quick Way To Check if 
Your Benefits May Be Taxable
Note. If you plan to file a joint income tax return, 
include your spouse's amounts, if any, on lines 
A, C, and D.
A. Enter the total amount from 
box 5 of all your Forms 
SSA-1099 and RRB-1099. 
Include the full amount of 
any lump-sum benefit 
payments received in 2022, 
for 2022 and earlier years. 
(If you received more than 
one form, combine the 
amounts from box 5 and 
enter the total.) . . . . . . .
A. 
Note. If the amount on line A is zero or less, 
stop here; none of your benefits are taxable this 
year.
B. Multiply line A by 50% 
(0.50) . . . . . . . . . . . . .
B. 
C. Enter your total income that 
is taxable (excluding line A), 
such as pensions, wages, 
interest, ordinary dividends, 
and capital gain 
distributions. Don’t reduce 
your income by any 
deductions, exclusions 
(listed earlier), or 
exemptions . . . . . . . . . .
C. 
D. Enter any tax-exempt 
interest income, such as 
interest on municipal 
bonds . . . . . . . . . . . . .
D. 
E. Add lines B, C, and D . . .
E. 
Note. Compare the amount on line E to your 
base amount for your filing status. If the 
amount on line E equals or is less than the base 
amount for your filing status, none of your 
benefits are taxable this year. If the amount on 
line E is more than your base amount, some of 
your benefits may be taxable and you will need 
to complete Worksheet 1 in Pub. 915 (or the 
Social Security Benefits Worksheet in your tax 
form instructions). If none of your benefits are 
taxable, but you must otherwise file a tax return, 
see Benefits not taxable, later, under How To 
Report Your Benefits.
Example. You and your spouse (both over 
65) are filing a joint return for 2022 and you both 
received social security benefits during the 
year. In January 2023, you received a Form 
SSA-1099 showing net benefits of $3,500 in 
box 5. Your spouse received a Form SSA-1099 
showing net benefits of $2,500 in box 5. You 
also received a taxable pension of $28,100 and 
interest income of $700. You didn’t have any 
tax-exempt interest income. Your benefits aren’t 
taxable for 2022 because your income, as fig-
ured in Worksheet 7-1, isn’t more than your 
base amount ($32,000) for married filing jointly.
Even though none of your benefits are taxa-
ble, you must file a return for 2022 because 
your taxable gross income ($28,800) exceeds 
the minimum filing requirement amount for your 
filing status.

Note. Compare the amount on line E to your 
base amount for your filing status. If the 
amount on line E equals or is less than the base 
amount for your filing status, none of your 
benefits are taxable this year. If the amount on 
line E is more than your base amount, some of 
your benefits may be taxable and you will need 
to complete Worksheet 1 in Pub. 915 (or the 
Social Security Benefits Worksheet in your tax 
form instructions). If none of your benefits are 
taxable, but you otherwise must file a tax return, 
see Benefits not taxable, later, under How To 
Report Your Benefits.
Who is taxed. Benefits are included in the tax-
able income (to the extent they are taxable) of 
the person who has the legal right to receive the 
benefits. For example, if you and your child re-
ceive benefits, but the check for your child is 
made out in your name, you must use only your 
part of the benefits to see whether any benefits 
are taxable to you. One-half of the part that be-
longs to your child must be added to your 
child's other income to see whether any of 
those benefits are taxable to your child.
Repayment of benefits. Any repayment of 
benefits you made during 2022 must be sub-
tracted from the gross benefits you received in 
2022. It doesn’t matter whether the repayment 
was for a benefit you received in 2022 or in an 
earlier year. If you repaid more than the gross 
benefits you received in 2022, see Repayments 
More Than Gross Benefits, later.
Your gross benefits are shown in box 3 of 
Form SSA-1099 or RRB-1099. Your repay-
ments are shown in box 4. The amount in box 5 
shows your net benefits for 2022 (box 3 minus 
box 4). Use the amount in box 5 to figure 
whether any of your benefits are taxable.
Tax withholding and estimated tax. You can 
choose to have federal income tax withheld 
from your social security benefits and/or the 
SSEB portion of your tier 1 railroad retirement 
benefits. If you choose to do this, you must 
complete a Form W-4V.
If you don’t choose to have income tax with-
held, you may have to request additional with-
holding from other income or pay estimated tax 
during the year. For details, see chapter 4, ear-
lier; Pub. 505; or the Instructions for Form 
1040-ES.
How To Report Your 
Benefits
If part of your benefits are taxable, you must use 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
Reporting on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Report 
your net benefits (the total amount from box 5 of 
all 
your 
Forms 
SSA-1099 
and 
Forms 
RRB-1099) on line 6a and the taxable part on 
line 6b. If you are married filing separately and 
you lived apart from your spouse for all of 2022, 
also enter “D” to the right of the word “benefits” 
on line 6a.
Benefits not taxable. Report your net benefits 
(the total amount from box 5 of all your Forms 
SSA-1099 and Forms RRB-1099) on Form 
1040 or 1040-SR, line 6a. Enter -0- on Form 
1040 or 1040-SR, line 6b. If you are married fil-
ing separately and you lived apart from your 
spouse for all of 2022, also enter “D” to the right 
of the word “benefits” on Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, line 6a.
How Much Is Taxable?
If part of your benefits are taxable, how much is 
taxable depends on the total amount of your 
benefits and other income. Generally, the 
higher that total amount, the greater the taxable 
part of your benefits.
Maximum taxable part. Generally, up to 50% 
of your benefits will be taxable. However, up to 
85% of your benefits can be taxable if either of 
the following situations applies to you.
•
The total of one-half of your benefits and 
all your other income is more than $34,000 
($44,000 if you are married filing jointly).
•
You are married filing separately and lived 
with your spouse at any time during 2022.
Which worksheet to use. A worksheet you 
can use to figure your taxable benefits is in the 
Instructions for Form 1040. You can use either 
that worksheet or Worksheet 1 in Pub. 915, un-
less any of the following situations applies to 
you.
1. You contributed to a traditional individual 
retirement arrangement (IRA) and you or 
your spouse is covered by a retirement 
plan at work. In this situation, you must 
use the special worksheets in Appendix B 
of Pub. 590-A to figure both your IRA de-
duction and your taxable benefits.
2. Situation 1 doesn’t apply and you take an 
exclusion for interest from qualified U.S. 
savings bonds (Form 8815), for adoption 
benefits (Form 8839), for foreign earned 
income or housing (Form 2555), or for in-
come earned in American Samoa (Form 
4563) or Puerto Rico by bona fide resi-
dents. In this situation, you must use 
Worksheet 1 in Pub. 915 to figure your tax-
able benefits.
3. You received a lump-sum payment for an 
earlier year. In this situation, also complete 
Worksheet 2 or 3 and Worksheet 4 in Pub. 
915. See Lump-sum election next.
Lump-sum election. You must include the 
taxable part of a lump-sum (retroactive) pay-
ment of benefits received in 2022 in your 2022 
income, even if the payment includes benefits 
for an earlier year.
Line 6c: Check the box on line 6c if you 
elect to use the lump-sum election 
method for your benefits. If any of your 
benefits are taxable for 2022 and they include a 
lump-sum benefit payment that was for an ear-
lier year, you may be able to reduce the taxable 
amount with the lump-sum election. See 
Lump-Sum Election in Pub. 915 for details.
This type of lump-sum benefit payment 
shouldn’t 
be 
confused 
with 
the 
lump-sum death benefit that both the 
SSA and RRB pay to many of their beneficia-
ries. No part of the lump-sum death benefit is 
subject to tax.
Generally, you use your 2022 income to fig-
ure the taxable part of the total benefits re-
ceived in 2022. However, you may be able to 
figure the taxable part of a lump-sum payment 
for an earlier year separately, using your in-
come for the earlier year. You can elect this 
method if it lowers your taxable benefits.
Making the election. If you received a 
lump-sum benefit payment in 2022 that includes 
benefits for one or more earlier years, follow the 
instructions in Pub. 915 under Lump-Sum Elec-
tion to see whether making the election will 
lower your taxable benefits. That discussion 
also explains how to make the election.
Because the earlier year's taxable ben-
efits are included in your 2022 income, 
no adjustment is made to the earlier 
year's return. Don’t file an amended return for 
the earlier year.
Examples
The following are a few examples you can use 
as a guide to figure the taxable part of your ben-
efits.
Example 1. George White is single and 
files Form 1040 for 2022. He received the fol-
lowing income in 2022.

box 5. Betty is a retired government worker and 
received a fully taxable pension of $38,000. 
They had $2,300 in taxable interest income plus 
interest of $200 on a qualified U.S. savings 
bond. The savings bond interest qualified for 
the exclusion. They figure their taxable benefits 
by completing Worksheet 1, shown below. Be-
cause they have qualified U.S. savings bond in-
terest, they follow the note at the beginning of 
the worksheet and use the amount from line 2 
of their Schedule B (Form 1040) on line 3 of the 
worksheet instead of the amount from line 2b of 
their Form 1040. On line 3 of the worksheet, 
they enter $40,500 ($38,000 + $2,500).

More than 50% of Joe's net benefits are tax-
able because the income on line 8 of the work-
sheet ($45,500) is more than $44,000. (See 
Maximum taxable part under How Much Is Tax-
able, earlier.) Joe and Betty enter $10,000 on 
Form 1040, line 6a; and $6,275 on Form 1040, 
line 6b.
Deductions Related to 
Your Benefits
You may be entitled to deduct certain amounts 
related to the benefits you receive.
Disability payments. You may have received 
disability payments from your employer or an in-
surance company that you included as income 
on your tax return in an earlier year. If you re-
ceived a lump-sum payment from the SSA or 
RRB, and you had to repay the employer or in-
surance company for the disability payments, 
you can take an itemized deduction for the part 
of the payments you included in gross income 
in the earlier year. If the amount you repay is 
more than $3,000, you may be able to claim a 
tax credit instead. Claim the deduction or credit 
in the same way explained under Repayment of 
benefits received in an earlier year under Re-
payments More Than Gross Benefits next.
Repayments More Than 
Gross Benefits
In some situations, your Form SSA-1099 or 
Form RRB-1099 will show that the total benefits 
you repaid (box 4) are more than the gross ben-
efits (box 3) you received. If this occurred, your 
Page 64 Chapter 7 Social Security and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits

net benefits in box 5 will be a negative figure (a 
figure in parentheses) and none of your benefits 
will be taxable. Don’t use a worksheet in this 
case. If you receive more than one form, a neg-
ative figure in box 5 of one form is used to offset 
a positive figure in box 5 of another form for that 
same year.
If you have any questions about this nega-
tive figure, contact your local SSA office or your 
local RRB field office.
Joint return. If you and your spouse file a joint 
return, and your Form SSA-1099 or RRB-1099 
has a negative figure in box 5, but your spou-
se's doesn’t, subtract the amount in box 5 of 
your form from the amount in box 5 of your 
spouse's form. You do this to get your net bene-
fits when figuring if your combined benefits are 
taxable.
Example. John and Mary file a joint return 
for 2022. John received Form SSA-1099 show-
ing $3,000 in box 5. Mary also received Form 
SSA-1099 and the amount in box 5 was ($500). 
John and Mary will use $2,500 ($3,000 minus 
$500) as the amount of their net benefits when 
figuring if any of their combined benefits are 
taxable.
Repayment of benefits received in an ear-
lier year. If the total amount shown in box 5 of 
all of your Forms SSA-1099 and RRB-1099 is a 
negative figure, you may be able to deduct part 
of this negative figure that represents benefits 
you included in gross income in an earlier year 
if the figure is more than $3,000. If the figure is 
$3,000 or less, it is a miscellaneous itemized 
deduction and can no longer be deducted.
Deduction more than $3,000. If this de-
duction is more than $3,000, you should figure 
your tax two ways.
1. Figure your tax for 2022 with the itemized 
deduction included on Schedule A (Form 
1040), line 16.
2. Figure your tax for 2022 in the following 
steps.
a. Figure the tax without the itemized de-
duction included on Schedule A 
(Form 1040), line 16.
b. For each year after 1983 for which 
part of the negative figure represents 
a repayment of benefits, refigure your 
taxable benefits as if your total bene-
fits for the year were reduced by that 
part of the negative figure. Then refig-
ure the tax for that year.
c. Subtract the total of the refigured tax 
amounts in (b) from the total of your 
actual tax amounts.
d. Subtract the result in (c) from the re-
sult in (a).
Compare the tax figured in methods 1 and 2. 
Your tax for 2022 is the smaller of the two 
amounts. If method 1 results in less tax, take 
the itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 
1040), line 16. If method 2 results in less tax, 
claim a credit for the amount from step 2c 
above on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 13z. En-
ter “I.R.C. 1341” on the entry line. If both meth-
ods produce the same tax, deduct the repay-
ment on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 16.

Introduction
You must include on your return all items of in-
come you receive in the form of money, prop-
erty, and services unless the tax law states that 
you don’t include them. Some items, however, 
are only partly excluded from income. This 
chapter discusses many kinds of income and 
explains whether they’re taxable or nontaxable.
•
Income that’s taxable must be reported on 
your tax return and is subject to tax.
•
Income that’s nontaxable may have to be 
shown on your tax return but isn’t taxable.
This chapter begins with discussions of the 
following income items.
•
Bartering.
•
Canceled debts.
•
Sales parties at which you’re the host or 
hostess.
•
Life insurance proceeds.
•
Partnership income.
•
S corporation income.
•
Recoveries (including state income tax re-
funds).
•
Rents from personal property.
•
Repayments.
•
Royalties.
•
Unemployment benefits.
•
Welfare and other public assistance bene-
fits.
These discussions are followed by brief discus-
sions of other income items.

Bartering
Bartering is an exchange of property or serv-
ices. You must include in your income, at the 
time received, the fair market value of property 
or services you receive in bartering. If you ex-
change services with another person and you 
both have agreed ahead of time on the value of 
the services, that value will be accepted as fair 
market value unless the value can be shown to 
be otherwise.
Generally, you report this income on Sched-
ule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Busi-
ness. However, if the barter involves an ex-
change of something other than services, such 
as in Example 3 below, you may have to use 
another form or schedule instead.
Example 1. You’re a self-employed attor-
ney who performs legal services for a client, a 
small corporation. The corporation gives you 
shares of its stock as payment for your serv-
ices. You must include the fair market value of 
the shares in your income on Schedule C (Form 
1040) in the year you receive them.
Example 2. You’re self-employed and a 
member of a barter club. The club uses “credit 
units” as a means of exchange. It adds credit 
units to your account for goods or services you 
provide to members, which you can use to pur-
chase goods or services offered by other mem-
bers of the barter club. The club subtracts credit 
units from your account when you receive 
goods or services from other members. You 
must include in your income the value of the 
credit units that are added to your account, 
even though you may not actually receive 
goods or services from other members until a 
later tax year.
Example 3. You own a small apartment 
building. In return for 6 months rent-free use of 
an apartment, an artist gives you a work of art 
she created. You must report as rental income 
on Schedule E (Form 1040), Supplemental In-
come and Loss, the fair market value of the art-
work, and the artist must report as income on 
Schedule C (Form 1040) the fair rental value of 
the apartment.
Form 1099-B from barter exchange. If you 
exchanged property or services through a bar-
ter exchange, Form 1099-B, Proceeds From 
Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions, or a 
similar statement from the barter exchange 
should be sent to you by February 15, 2023. It 
should show the value of cash, property,

Chapter 8 Other Income Page 65

services, credits, or scrip you received from ex-
changes during 2022. The IRS will also receive 
a copy of Form 1099-B.
Canceled Debts
In most cases, if a debt you owe is canceled or 
forgiven, other than as a gift or bequest, you 
must include the canceled amount in your in-
come. You have no income from the canceled 
debt if it’s intended as a gift to you. A debt in-
cludes any indebtedness for which you’re liable 
or which attaches to property you hold.
If the debt is a nonbusiness debt, report the 
canceled amount on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), 
line 8c. If it’s a business debt, report the amount 
on Schedule C (Form 1040) (or on Schedule F 
(Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Farming, if the 
debt is farm debt and you’re a farmer).
Form 1099-C. If a federal government agency, 
financial institution, or credit union cancels or 
forgives a debt you owe of $600 or more, you 
will receive a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of 
Debt. The amount of the canceled debt is 
shown in box 2.
Interest included in canceled debt. If any 
interest is forgiven and included in the amount 
of canceled debt in box 2, the amount of inter-
est will also be shown in box 3. Whether or not 
you must include the interest portion of the can-
celed debt in your income depends on whether 
the interest would be deductible when you paid 
it. See Deductible debt under Exceptions, later.
If the interest wouldn’t be deductible (such 
as interest on a personal loan), include in your 
income the amount from box 2 of Form 1099-C. 
If the interest would be deductible (such as on a 
business loan), include in your income the net 
amount of the canceled debt (the amount 
shown in box 2 less the interest amount shown 
in box 3).
Discounted mortgage loan. If your financial 
institution offers a discount for the early pay-
ment of your mortgage loan, the amount of the 
discount is canceled debt. You must include the 
canceled amount in your income.
Mortgage relief upon sale or other disposi-
tion. If you’re personally liable for a mortgage 
(recourse debt), and you’re relieved of the mort-
gage when you dispose of the property, you 
may realize gain or loss up to the fair market 
value of the property. Also, to the extent the 
mortgage discharge exceeds the fair market 
value of the property, it’s income from dis-
charge of indebtedness unless it qualifies for 
exclusion under Excluded debt, later. Report 
any income from discharge of indebtedness on 
nonbusiness debt that doesn’t qualify for exclu-
sion as other income on Schedule 1 (Form 
1040), line 8c.
If you aren’t personally liable for a mortgage 
(nonrecourse debt), and you’re relieved of the 
mortgage when you dispose of the property 
(such as through foreclosure), that relief is in-
cluded in the amount you realize. You may have 
a taxable gain if the amount you realize ex-
ceeds your adjusted basis in the property. Re-
port any gain on nonbusiness property as a 
capital gain.
See Pub. 4681 for more information.
Stockholder debt. If you’re a stockholder in a 
corporation and the corporation cancels or for-
gives your debt to it, the canceled debt is a con-
structive distribution that’s generally dividend 
income to you. For more information, see Pub. 
542, Corporations.
If you’re a stockholder in a corporation and 
you cancel a debt owed to you by the corpora-
tion, you generally don’t realize income. This is 
because the canceled debt is considered as a 
contribution to the capital of the corporation 
equal to the amount of debt principal that you 
canceled.
Repayment of canceled debt. If you included 
a canceled amount in your income and later pay 
the debt, you may be able to file a claim for re-
fund for the year the amount was included in in-
come. You can file a claim on Form 1040-X, 
Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, if 
the statute of limitations for filing a claim is still 
open. The statute of limitations generally 
doesn’t end until 3 years after the due date of 
your original return.
Exceptions
There are several exceptions to the inclusion of 
canceled debt in income. These are explained 
next.
Student loans. Certain student loans contain 
a provision that all or part of the debt incurred to 
attend the qualified educational institution will 
be canceled if you work for a certain period of 
time in certain professions for any of a broad 
class of employers.
You don’t have income if your student loan 
is canceled after you agreed to this provision 
and then performed the services required. To 
qualify, the loan must have been made by:
1. The federal government, a state or local 
government, or an instrumentality, agency, 
or subdivision thereof;
2. A tax-exempt public benefit corporation 
that has assumed control of a state, 
county, or municipal hospital, and whose 
employees are considered public employ-
ees under state law; or
3. An educational institution:
a. Under an agreement with an entity de-
scribed in (1) or (2) that provided the 
funds to the institution to make the 
loan, or
b. As part of a program of the institution 
designed to encourage its students to 
serve in occupations with unmet 
needs or in areas with unmet needs 
and under which the services provi-
ded by the students (or former stu-
dents) are for or under the direction of 
a governmental unit or a tax-exempt 
organization described in section 
501(c)(3).
A loan to refinance a qualified student loan 
will also qualify if it was made by an educational 
institution or a qualified tax-exempt organization 
under its program designed as described in 
item 3b above.
Special rule for student loan discharges for 
2021 through 2025. The American Rescue 
Plan Act of 2021 modified the treatment of stu-
dent loan forgiveness for discharges in 2021 
through 2025. Generally, if you are responsible 
for making loan payments, and the loan is can-
celed or repaid by someone else, you must in-
clude the amount that was canceled or paid on 
your behalf in your gross income for tax purpo-
ses. However, in certain circumstances you 
may be able to exclude this amount from gross 
income if the loan was one of the following.
•
A loan for postsecondary educational ex-
penses.
•
A private education loan.
•
A loan from an educational organization 
described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii).
•
A loan from an organization exempt from 
tax under section 501(a) to refinance a stu-
dent loan.
See Pub. 4681 and Pub. 970 for more informa-
tion.
Education loan repayment assistance. 
Education loan repayments made to you by the 
National Health Service Corps Loan Repay-
ment Program (NHSC Loan Repayment Pro-
gram), a state education loan repayment pro-
gram eligible for funds under the Public Health 
Service Act, or any other state loan repayment 
or loan forgiveness program that’s intended to 
provide for the increased availability of health 
services in underserved or health professional 
shortage areas aren’t taxable.
Deductible debt. You don’t have income from 
the cancellation of a debt if your payment of the 
debt would be deductible. This exception ap-
plies only if you use the cash method of ac-
counting. For more information, see chapter 5 
of Pub. 334, Tax Guide for Small Business.
Price reduced after purchase. In most ca-
ses, if the seller reduces the amount of debt you 
owe for property you purchased, you don’t have 
income from the reduction. The reduction of the 
debt is treated as a purchase price adjustment 
and reduces your basis in the property.
Excluded debt. Don’t include a canceled debt 
in your gross income in the following situations.
•
The debt is canceled in a bankruptcy case 
under title 11 of the U.S. Code. See Pub. 
908, Bankruptcy Tax Guide. 
•
The debt is canceled when you’re insol-
vent. However, you can’t exclude any 
amount of canceled debt that’s more than 
the amount by which you’re insolvent. See 
Pub. 908. 
•
The debt is qualified farm debt and is can-
celed by a qualified person. See chapter 3 
of Pub. 225, Farmer's Tax Guide. 
•
The debt is qualified real property business 
debt. See chapter 5 of Pub. 334. 
•
The cancellation is intended as a gift.
•
The debt is qualified principal residence in-
debtedness.
Host
If you host a party or event at which sales are 
made, any gift or gratuity you receive for giving 
the event is a payment for helping a direct seller 
Page 66 Chapter 8 Other Income

make sales. You must report this item as in-
come at its fair market value.
Your out-of-pocket party expenses are sub-
ject to the 50% limit for meal expenses. For tax 
years 2018 and after, no deduction is allowed 
for any expenses related to activities generally 
considered entertainment, amusement, or rec-
reation. Taxpayers may continue to deduct 50% 
of the cost of business meals if the taxpayer (or 
an employee of the taxpayer) is present and the 
food or beverages are not considered lavish or 
extravagant. The meals may be provided to a 
current or potential business customer, client, 
consultant, or similar business contact. Food 
and beverages that are provided during enter-
tainment events will not be considered enter-
tainment if purchased separately from the 
event.
Section 210 of the Taxpayer Certainty and 
Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 provides for the 
temporary allowance of a 100% business meal 
deduction for food or beverages provided by a 
restaurant and paid or incurred after December 
31, 2020, and before January 1, 2023.
For more information about the limit for meal 
expenses, see Pub. 463, Travel, Gift, and Car 
Expenses.
Life Insurance 
Proceeds
Life insurance proceeds paid to you because of 
the death of the insured person aren’t taxable 
unless the policy was turned over to you for a 
price. This is true even if the proceeds were 
paid under an accident or health insurance pol-
icy or an endowment contract. However, inter-
est income received as a result of life insurance 
proceeds may be taxable.
Proceeds not received in installments. If 
death benefits are paid to you in a lump sum or 
other than at regular intervals, include in your 
income only the benefits that are more than the 
amount payable to you at the time of the in-
sured person's death. If the benefit payable at 
death isn’t specified, you include in your income 
the benefit payments that are more than the 
present value of the payments at the time of 
death.
Proceeds received in installments. If you re-
ceive life insurance proceeds in installments, 
you can exclude part of each installment from 
your income.
To determine the excluded part, divide the 
amount held by the insurance company (gener-
ally, the total lump sum payable at the death of 
the insured person) by the number of install-
ments to be paid. Include anything over this ex-
cluded part in your income as interest.
Surviving spouse. If your spouse died be-
fore October 23, 1986, and insurance proceeds 
paid to you because of the death of your 
spouse are received in installments, you can 
exclude up to $1,000 a year of the interest in-
cluded in the installments. If you remarry, you 
can continue to take the exclusion.
Surrender of policy for cash. If you surren-
der a life insurance policy for cash, you must in-
clude in income any proceeds that are more 
than the cost of the life insurance policy. In most 
cases, your cost (or investment in the contract) 
is the total of premiums that you paid for the life 
insurance policy, less any refunded premiums, 
rebates, dividends, or unrepaid loans that 
weren’t included in your income.
You should receive a Form 1099-R showing 
the total proceeds and the taxable part. Report 
these amounts on lines 5a and 5b of Form 1040 
or 1040-SR.
More information.  For more information, see 
Life Insurance Proceeds in Pub. 525.
Endowment Contract 
Proceeds
An endowment contract is a policy under which 
you’re paid a specified amount of money on a 
certain date unless you die before that date, in 
which case the money is paid to your designa-
ted beneficiary. Endowment proceeds paid in a 
lump sum to you at maturity are taxable only if 
the proceeds are more than the cost of the pol-
icy. To determine your cost, subtract any 
amount that you previously received under the 
contract and excluded from your income from 
the total premiums (or other consideration) paid 
for the contract. Include in your income the part 
of the lump-sum payment that’s more than your 
cost.
Accelerated Death 
Benefits
Certain amounts paid as accelerated death 
benefits under a life insurance contract or viati-
cal settlement before the insured's death are 
excluded from income if the insured is termi-
nally or chronically ill.
Viatical settlement. This is the sale or assign-
ment of any part of the death benefit under a life 
insurance contract to a viatical settlement pro-
vider. A viatical settlement provider is a person 
who regularly engages in the business of buy-
ing or taking assignment of life insurance con-
tracts on the lives of insured individuals who are 
terminally or chronically ill and who meets the 
requirements of section 101(g)(2)(B) of the In-
ternal Revenue Code.
Exclusion for terminal illness. Accelerated 
death benefits are fully excludable if the insured 
is a terminally ill individual. This is a person who 
has been certified by a physician as having an 
illness or physical condition that can reasonably 
be expected to result in death within 24 months 
from the date of the certification.
Exclusion for chronic illness. If the insured 
is a chronically ill individual who’s not terminally 
ill, accelerated death benefits paid on the basis 
of costs incurred for qualified long-term care 
services are fully excludable. Accelerated death 
benefits paid on a per diem or other periodic 
basis are excludable up to a limit. For 2022, this 
limit is $390. It applies to the total of the accel-
erated death benefits and any periodic pay-
ments received from long-term care insurance 
contracts. For information on the limit and the 
definitions of chronically ill individual, qualified 
long-term care services, and long-term care in-
surance contracts, see Long-Term Care Insur-
ance Contracts under Sickness and Injury Ben-
efits in Pub. 525.
Exception. The exclusion doesn’t apply to any 
amount paid to a person (other than the in-
sured) who has an insurable interest in the life 
of the insured because the insured:
•
Is a director, officer, or employee of the 
person; or
•
Has a financial interest in the person's 
business.
Form 8853. To claim an exclusion for acceler-
ated death benefits made on a per diem or 
other periodic basis, you must file Form 8853, 
Archer MSAs and Long-Term Care Insurance 
Contracts, with your return. You don’t have to 
file Form 8853 to exclude accelerated death 
benefits paid on the basis of actual expenses 
incurred.
Public Safety Officer Killed 
or Injured in the Line of 
Duty
A spouse, former spouse, and child of a public 
safety officer killed in the line of duty can ex-
clude from gross income survivor benefits re-
ceived from a governmental section 401(a) plan 
attributable to the officer’s service. See section 
101(h).
A public safety officer who’s permanently 
and totally disabled or killed in the line of duty 
and a surviving spouse or child can exclude 
from income death or disability benefits re-
ceived from the federal Bureau of Justice Assis-
tance or death benefits paid by a state program. 
See section 104(a)(6).
For this purpose, the term “public safety offi-
cer” includes law enforcement officers, firefight-
ers, chaplains, and rescue squad and ambu-
lance crew members. For more information, see 
Pub. 559, Survivors, Executors, and Adminis-
trators.
Partnership Income
A partnership generally isn’t a taxable entity. 
The income, gains, losses, deductions, and 
credits of a partnership are passed through to 
the partners based on each partner's distribu-
tive share of these items.
Schedule K-1 (Form 1065). Although a part-
nership generally pays no tax, it must file an in-
formation return on Form 1065, U.S. Return of 
Partnership Income, and send Schedule K-1 
(Form 1065) to each partner. In addition, the 
partnership will send each partner a copy of the 
Partner's Instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 
1065) to help each partner report his or her 
share of the partnership's income, deductions, 
credits, and tax preference items.
Keep Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) for 
your records. Don’t attach it to your 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR, unless you’re 
specifically required to do so.
For more information on partnerships, see 
Pub. 541, Partnerships.
Qualified joint venture.  If you and your 
spouse each materially participate as the only 
RECORDS
Chapter 8 Other Income Page 67

members of a jointly owned and operated busi-
ness, and you file a joint return for the tax year, 
you can make a joint election to be treated as a 
qualified joint venture instead of a partnership. 
To make this election, you must divide all items 
of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit at-
tributable to the business between you and your 
spouse in accordance with your respective in-
terests in the venture. For further information on 
how to make the election and which sched-
ule(s) to file, see the instructions for your indi-
vidual tax return.
S Corporation Income
In most cases, an S corporation doesn’t pay tax 
on its income. Instead, the income, losses, de-
ductions, and credits of the corporation are 
passed through to the shareholders based on 
each shareholder's pro rata share.
Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S). An S corpora-
tion must file a return on Form 1120-S, U.S. In-
come Tax Return for an S Corporation, and 
send Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) to each 
shareholder. In addition, the S corporation will 
send each shareholder a copy of the Share-
holder's Instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 
1120-S) to help each shareholder report her or 
his share of the S corporation's income, losses, 
credits, and deductions.
Keep Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) for 
your records. Don’t attach it to your 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR, unless you’re 
specifically required to do so.
For more information on S corporations and 
their shareholders, see the Instructions for Form 
1120-S.
Recoveries
A recovery is a return of an amount you deduc-
ted or took a credit for in an earlier year. The 
most common recoveries are refunds, reim-
bursements, and rebates of deductions item-
ized on Schedule A (Form 1040). You may also 
have recoveries of nonitemized deductions 
(such as payments on previously deducted bad 
debts) and recoveries of items for which you 
previously claimed a tax credit.
Tax benefit rule. You must include a recovery 
in your income in the year you receive it up to 
the amount by which the deduction or credit you 
took for the recovered amount reduced your tax 
in the earlier year. For this purpose, any in-
crease to an amount carried over to the current 
year that resulted from the deduction or credit is 
considered to have reduced your tax in the ear-
lier year. For more information, see Pub. 525.
Federal income tax refund. Refunds of fed-
eral income taxes aren’t included in your in-
come because they’re never allowed as a de-
duction from income.
State tax refund. If you received a state or lo-
cal income tax refund (or credit or offset) in 
2022, you must generally include it in income if 
you deducted the tax in an earlier year. The 
payer should send Form 1099-G to you by Jan-
uary 31, 2023. The IRS will also receive a copy 
of the Form 1099-G. If you file Form 1040 or 
1040-SR, use the State and Local Income Tax 
RECORDS
Refund Worksheet in the 2022 instructions for 
Schedule 1 (Form 1040) to figure the amount (if 
any) to include in your income. See Pub. 525 for 
when you must use another worksheet.
If you could choose to deduct for a tax year 
either:
•
State and local income taxes, or
•
State and local general sales taxes, then
the maximum refund that you may have to in-
clude in income is limited to the excess of the 
tax you chose to deduct for that year over the 
tax you didn’t choose to deduct for that year. 
For examples, see Pub. 525.
Mortgage interest refund. If you received a 
refund or credit in 2022 of mortgage interest 
paid in an earlier year, the amount should be 
shown in box 4 of your Form 1098, Mortgage In-
terest Statement. Don’t subtract the refund 
amount from the interest you paid in 2022. You 
may have to include it in your income under the 
rules explained in the following discussions.
Interest on recovery. Interest on any of the 
amounts you recover must be reported as inter-
est income in the year received. For example, 
report any interest you received on state or lo-
cal income tax refunds on Form 1040, 
1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 2b.
Recovery and expense in same year. If the 
refund or other recovery and the expense occur 
in the same year, the recovery reduces the de-
duction or credit and isn’t reported as income.
Recovery for 2 or more years. If you receive 
a refund or other recovery that’s for amounts 
you paid in 2 or more separate years, you must 
allocate, on a pro rata basis, the recovered 
amount between the years in which you paid it. 
This allocation is necessary to determine the 
amount of recovery from any earlier years and 
to determine the amount, if any, of your allowa-
ble deduction for this item for the current year. 
For information on how to figure the allocation, 
see Recoveries in Pub. 525.
Itemized Deduction 
Recoveries
If you recover any amount that you deducted in 
an earlier year on Schedule A (Form 1040), you 
must generally include the full amount of the re-
covery in your income in the year you receive it.
Where to report. Enter your state or local in-
come tax refund on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), 
line 1, and the total of all other recoveries as 
other income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), 
line 8z.
Standard deduction limit. You are generally 
allowed to claim the standard deduction if you 
don’t itemize your deductions. Only your item-
ized deductions that are more than your stand-
ard deduction are subject to the recovery rule 
(unless you’re required to itemize your deduc-
tions). If your total deductions on the earlier 
year return weren’t more than your income for 
that year, include in your income this year the 
lesser of:
•
Your recoveries, or
•
The amount by which your itemized deduc-
tions exceeded the standard deduction.
Example. For 2021, you filed a joint return. 
Your taxable income was $60,000 and you 
weren’t entitled to any tax credits. Your stand-
ard deduction was $25,100, and you had item-
ized deductions of $26,600. In 2022, you re-
ceived the following recoveries for amounts 
deducted on your 2021 return.
Medical expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
$200
State and local income tax refund . . . . . . .
400
Refund of mortgage interest . . . . . . . . . .
325
Total recoveries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
$925
None of the recoveries were more than the de-
ductions taken for 2021. The difference be-
tween the state and local income tax you de-
ducted and your local general sales tax was 
more than $400.
Your total recoveries are less than the 
amount by which your itemized deductions ex-
ceeded the standard deduction ($26,600 − 
$25,100 = $1,500), so you must include your to-
tal recoveries in your income for 2022. Report 
the state and local income tax refund of $400 
on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 1, and the bal-
ance of your recoveries, $525, on Schedule 1 
(Form 1040), line 8z.
Standard deduction for earlier years. To de-
termine if amounts recovered in the current year 
must be included in your income, you must 
know the standard deduction for your filing sta-
tus for the year the deduction was claimed. 
Look in the instructions for your tax return from 
prior years to locate the standard deduction for 
the filing status for that prior year.
Example. You filed a joint return on Form 
1040 for 2021 with taxable income of $45,000. 
Your itemized deductions were $25,350. The 
standard deduction that you could have claimed 
was $25,100. In 2022, you recovered $2,100 of 
your 2021 itemized deductions. None of the re-
coveries were more than the actual deductions 
for 2021. Include $250 of the recoveries in your 
2022 income. This is the smaller of your recov-
eries ($2,100) or the amount by which your 
itemized deductions were more than the stand-
ard deduction ($25,350 − $25,100 = $250).
Recovery limited to deduction. You don’t in-
clude in your income any amount of your recov-
ery that’s more than the amount you deducted 
in the earlier year. The amount you include in 
your income is limited to the smaller of:
•
The amount deducted on Schedule A 
(Form 1040), or
•
The amount recovered.
Example. During 2021, you paid $1,700 for 
medical expenses. Of this amount, you deduc-
ted $200 on your 2021 Schedule A (Form 
1040). In 2022, you received a $500 reimburse-
ment from your medical insurance for your 2021 
expenses. The only amount of the $500 reim-
bursement that must be included in your in-
come for 2022 is $200—the amount actually 
deducted.
Other recoveries. See Recoveries in Pub. 
525 if:
•
You have recoveries of items other than 
itemized deductions, or
Page 68 Chapter 8 Other Income

•
You received a recovery for an item for 
which you claimed a tax credit (other than 
investment credit or foreign tax credit) in a 
prior year.
Rents From Personal 
Property
If you rent out personal property, such as equip-
ment or vehicles, how you report your income 
and expenses is in most cases determined by:
•
Whether or not the rental activity is a busi-
ness, and
•
Whether or not the rental activity is con-
ducted for profit.
In most cases, if your primary purpose is in-
come or profit and you’re involved in the rental 
activity with continuity and regularity, your rental 
activity is a business. See Pub. 535, Business 
Expenses, for details on deducting expenses 
for both business and not-for-profit activities.
Reporting business income and expenses. 
If you’re in the business of renting personal 
property, report your income and expenses on 
Schedule C (Form 1040). The form instructions 
have information on how to complete them.
Reporting nonbusiness income. If you aren’t 
in the business of renting personal property, re-
port your rental income on Schedule 1 (Form 
1040), line 8l.
Reporting nonbusiness expenses. If you 
rent personal property for profit, include your 
rental expenses in the total amount you enter 
on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 24b, and see 
the instructions there.
If you don’t rent personal property for profit, 
your deductions are limited and you can’t report 
a loss to offset other income. See Activity not 
for profit under Other Income, later.
Repayments
If you had to repay an amount that you included 
in your income in an earlier year, you may be 
able to deduct the amount repaid from your in-
come for the year in which you repaid it. Or, if 
the amount you repaid is more than $3,000, you 
may be able to take a credit against your tax for 
the year in which you repaid it. Generally, you 
can claim a deduction or credit only if the repay-
ment qualifies as an expense or loss incurred in 
your trade or business or in a for-profit transac-
tion.
Type of deduction. The type of deduction 
you’re allowed in the year of repayment de-
pends on the type of income you included in the 
earlier year. You generally deduct the repay-
ment on the same form or schedule on which 
you previously reported it as income. For exam-
ple, if you reported it as self-employment in-
come, deduct it as a business expense on 
Schedule C (Form 1040) or Schedule F (Form 
1040). If you reported it as a capital gain, de-
duct it as a capital loss as explained in the In-
structions for Schedule D (Form 1040). If you 
reported it as wages, unemployment compen-
sation, or other nonbusiness income, you may 
be able to deduct it as an other itemized deduc-
tion if the amount repaid is over $3,000.
Beginning in 2018, you can no longer 
claim any miscellaneous itemized de-
ductions, so if the amount repaid was 
$3,000 or less, you are not able to deduct it 
from your income in the year you repaid it.
Repaid social security benefits. If you repaid 
social security benefits or equivalent railroad re-
tirement benefits, see Repayment of benefits in 
chapter 7.
Repayment over $3,000. If the amount you 
repaid was more than $3,000, you can deduct 
the repayment as an other itemized deduction 
on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 16, if you in-
cluded the income under a claim of right. This 
means that at the time you included the income, 
it appeared that you had an unrestricted right to 
it. However, you can choose to take a credit for 
the year of repayment. Figure your tax under 
both methods and compare the results. Use the 
method (deduction or credit) that results in less 
tax.
When determining whether the amount 
you repaid was more or less than 
$3,000, consider the total amount be-
ing repaid on the return. Each instance of re-
payment isn’t considered separately.
Method 1. Figure your tax for 2022 claiming 
a deduction for the repaid amount. If you deduct 
it as an other itemized deduction, enter it on 
Schedule A (Form 1040), line 16.
Method 2. Figure your tax for 2022 claiming 
a credit for the repaid amount. Follow these 
steps.
1. Figure your tax for 2022 without deducting 
the repaid amount.
2. Refigure your tax from the earlier year 
without including in income the amount 
you repaid in 2022.
3. Subtract the tax in (2) from the tax shown 
on your return for the earlier year. This is 
the credit.
4. Subtract the answer in (3) from the tax for 
2022 figured without the deduction (step 
1).
If method 1 results in less tax, deduct the 
amount repaid. If method 2 results in less tax, 
claim the credit figured in (3) above on Sched-
ule 3 (Form 1040), line 13d, by adding the 
amount of the credit to any other credits on this 
line, and see the instructions there.
An example of this computation can be 
found in Pub. 525.
Repaid wages subject to social security 
and Medicare taxes. If you had to repay an 
amount that you included in your wages or com-
pensation in an earlier year on which social se-
curity, Medicare, or tier 1 RRTA taxes were 
paid, ask your employer to refund the excess 
amount to you. If the employer refuses to refund 
the taxes, ask for a statement indicating the 
amount of the overcollection to support your 
claim. File a claim for refund using Form 843, 
Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement.
Repaid wages subject to Additional Medi-
care Tax. Employers can’t make an adjust-
ment or file a claim for refund for Additional 
Medicare Tax withholding when there is a re-

payment of wages received by an employee in 
a prior year because the employee determines 
liability for Additional Medicare Tax on the em-
ployee's income tax return for the prior year. If 
you had to repay an amount that you included in 
your wages or compensation in an earlier year, 
and on which Additional Medicare Tax was 
paid, you may be able to recover the Additional 
Medicare Tax paid on the amount. To recover 
Additional Medicare Tax on the repaid wages or 
compensation, you must file Form 1040-X for 
the prior year in which the wages or compensa-
tion was originally received. See the Instruc-
tions for Form 1040-X.
Royalties
Royalties from copyrights, patents, and oil, gas, 
and mineral properties are taxable as ordinary 
income. 
In most cases, you report royalties in Part I 
of Schedule E (Form 1040). However, if you 
hold an operating oil, gas, or mineral interest or 
are in business as a self-employed writer, in-
ventor, artist, etc., report your income and ex-
penses on Schedule C (Form 1040).
Copyrights 
and 
patents. Royalties 
from 
copyrights on literary, musical, or artistic works, 
and similar property, or from patents on inven-
tions, are amounts paid to you for the right to 
use your work over a specified period of time. 
Royalties are generally based on the number of 
units sold, such as the number of books, tickets 
to a performance, or machines sold.
Oil, gas, and minerals. Royalty income from 
oil, gas, and mineral properties is the amount 
you receive when natural resources are extrac-
ted from your property. The royalties are based 
on units, such as barrels, tons, etc., and are 
paid to you by a person or company that leases 
the property from you.
Depletion. If you’re the owner of an eco-
nomic interest in mineral deposits or oil and gas 
wells, you can recover your investment through 
the depletion allowance. For information on this 
subject, see chapter 9 of Pub. 535.
Coal and iron ore. Under certain circum-
stances, you can treat amounts you receive 
from the disposal of coal and iron ore as pay-
ments from the sale of a capital asset, rather 
than as royalty income. For information about 
gain or loss from the sale of coal and iron ore, 
see chapter 2 of Pub. 544.
Sale of property interest. If you sell your 
complete interest in oil, gas, or mineral rights, 
the amount you receive is considered payment 
for the sale of property used in a trade or busi-
ness under section 1231, not royalty income. 
Under certain circumstances, the sale is subject 
to capital gain or loss treatment as explained in 
the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). 
For more information on selling section 1231 
property, see chapter 3 of Pub. 544.
If you retain a royalty, an overriding royalty, 
or a net profit interest in a mineral property for 
the life of the property, you have made a lease 
or a sublease, and any cash you receive for the 
assignment of other interests in the property is 
ordinary income subject to a depletion allow-
ance.
Chapter 8 Other Income Page 69

Part of future production sold. If you own 
mineral property but sell part of the future pro-
duction, in most cases you treat the money you 
receive from the buyer at the time of the sale as 
a loan from the buyer. Don’t include it in your in-
come or take depletion based on it.
When production begins, you include all the 
proceeds in your income, deduct all the produc-
tion expenses, and deduct depletion from that 
amount to arrive at your taxable income from 
the property.
Unemployment 
Benefits
The tax treatment of unemployment benefits 
you receive depends on the type of program 
paying the benefits.
Unemployment compensation. You must in-
clude in income all unemployment compensa-
tion you receive. You should receive a Form 
1099-G showing in box 1 the total unemploy-
ment compensation paid to you. In most cases, 
you enter unemployment compensation on 
Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 7.
If you received unemployment com-
pensation but did not receive Form 
1099-G through the mail, you may 
need to access your information through your 
state’s website to get your electronic Form 
1099-G.
Types of unemployment compensation. 
Unemployment compensation generally in-
cludes any amount received under an unem-
ployment compensation law of the United 
States or of a state. It includes the following 
benefits.
•
Benefits paid by a state or the District of 
Columbia from the Federal Unemployment 
Trust Fund.
•
State unemployment insurance benefits.
•
Railroad unemployment compensation 
benefits.
•
Disability payments from a government 
program paid as a substitute for unemploy-
ment compensation. (Amounts received as 
workers' compensation for injuries or ill-
ness aren’t unemployment compensation. 
See chapter 5 for more information.)
•
Trade readjustment allowances under the 
Trade Act of 1974.
•
Unemployment assistance under the Dis-
aster Relief and Emergency Assistance 
Act.
•
Unemployment assistance under the Air-
line Deregulation Act of 1978 Program.
Governmental program. If you contribute 
to a governmental unemployment compensa-
tion program and your contributions aren’t de-
ductible, amounts you receive under the pro-
gram 
aren’t 
included 
as 
unemployment 
compensation until you recover your contribu-
tions. If you deducted all of your contributions to 
the program, the entire amount you receive un-
der the program is included in your income.
CAUTION
!
Repayment of unemployment compensa-
tion. If you repaid in 2022 unemployment com-
pensation you received in 2022, subtract the 
amount you repaid from the total amount you 
received and enter the difference on Schedule 
1 (Form 1040), line 7. On the dotted line next to 
your entry, enter “Repaid” and the amount you 
repaid. If you repaid unemployment compensa-
tion in 2022 that you included in income in an 
earlier year, you can deduct the amount repaid 
on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 16, if you item-
ize deductions and the amount is more than 
$3,000. See Repayments, earlier.
Tax withholding. You can choose to have 
federal income tax withheld from your unem-
ployment compensation. To make this choice, 
complete Form W-4V, Voluntary Withholding 
Request, and give it to the paying office. Tax 
will be withheld at 10% of your payment.
If you don’t choose to have tax withheld 
from your unemployment compensa-
tion, you may be liable for estimated 
tax. If you don’t pay enough tax, either through 
withholding or estimated tax, or a combination 
of both, you may have to pay a penalty. For 
more information on estimated tax, see chap-
ter 4.
Supplemental 
unemployment 
benefits. 
Benefits received from an employer-financed 
fund (to which the employees didn’t contribute) 
aren’t unemployment compensation. They are 
taxable as wages. For more information, see 
Supplemental Unemployment Benefits in sec-
tion 5 of Pub. 15-A, Employer's Supplemental 
Tax Guide. Report these payments on line 1a of 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
Repayment of benefits. You may have to 
repay some of your supplemental unemploy-
ment benefits to qualify for trade readjustment 
allowances under the Trade Act of 1974. If you 
repay supplemental unemployment benefits in 
the same year you receive them, reduce the to-
tal benefits by the amount you repay. If you re-
pay the benefits in a later year, you must in-
clude the full amount of the benefits received in 
your income for the year you received them.
Deduct the repayment in the later year as an 
adjustment to gross income on Form 1040 or 
1040-SR. Include the repayment on Schedule 1 
(Form 1040), line 24e, and see the instructions 
there. If the amount you repay in a later year is 
more than $3,000, you may be able to take a 
credit against your tax for the later year instead 
of deducting the amount repaid. For more infor-
mation on this, see Repayments, earlier.
Private unemployment fund. Unemployment 
benefit payments from a private (nonunion) 
fund to which you voluntarily contribute are tax-
able only if the amounts you receive are more 
than your total payments into the fund. Report 
the taxable amount on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), 
line 8z.
Payments by a union. Benefits paid to you as 
an unemployed member of a union from regular 
union dues are included in your income on 
Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z. However, if 
you contribute to a special union fund and your 
payments to the fund aren’t deductible, the un-
employment benefits you receive from the fund 
CAUTION
!
are includible in your income only to the extent 
they’re more than your contributions.
Guaranteed annual wage. Payments you re-
ceive from your employer during periods of un-
employment, under a union agreement that 
guarantees you full pay during the year, are tax-
able as wages. Include them on line 1a of Form 
1040 or 1040-SR.
State employees. Payments similar to a 
state's unemployment compensation may be 
made by the state to its employees who aren’t 
covered by the state's unemployment compen-
sation law. Although the payments are fully tax-
able, don’t report them as unemployment com-
pensation. Report these payments on Schedule 
1 (Form 1040), line 8z.
Welfare and Other 
Public Assistance 
Benefits
Don’t include in your income governmental ben-
efit payments from a public welfare fund based 
upon need, such as payments to blind individu-
als under a state public assistance law. Pay-
ments from a state fund for the victims of crime 
shouldn’t be included in the victims' incomes if 
they’re in the nature of welfare payments. Don’t 
deduct medical expenses that are reimbursed 
by such a fund. You must include in your in-
come any welfare payments that are compen-
sation for services or that are obtained fraudu-
lently.
Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assis-
tance (RTAA) payments.  RTAA payments 
received from a state must be included in your 
income. The state must send you Form 1099-G 
to advise you of the amount you should include 
in income. The amount should be reported on 
Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z.
Persons with disabilities. If you have a disa-
bility, you must include in income compensation 
you receive for services you perform unless the 
compensation is otherwise excluded. However, 
you don’t include in income the value of goods, 
services, and cash that you receive, not in re-
turn for your services, but for your training and 
rehabilitation because you have a disability. Ex-
cludable amounts include payments for trans-
portation and attendant care, such as inter-
preter services for the deaf, reader services for 
the blind, and services to help individuals with 
an intellectual disability do their work.
Disaster relief grants. Don’t include post-dis-
aster grants received under the Robert T. Staf-
ford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance 
Act in your income if the grant payments are 
made to help you meet necessary expenses or 
serious needs for medical, dental, housing, per-
sonal property, transportation, childcare, or fu-
neral expenses. Don’t deduct casualty losses or 
medical expenses that are specifically reim-
bursed by these disaster relief grants. If you 
have deducted a casualty loss for the loss of 
your personal residence and you later receive a 
disaster relief grant for the loss of the same res-
idence, you may have to include part or all of 
the grant in your taxable income. See Recover-
ies, earlier. Unemployment assistance pay-
ments under the Act are taxable unemployment 
Page 70 Chapter 8 Other Income

compensation. See Unemployment compensa-
tion under Unemployment Benefits, earlier.
Disaster relief payments. You can exclude 
from income any amount you receive that’s a 
qualified disaster relief payment. A qualified dis-
aster relief payment is an amount paid to you:
1. To reimburse or pay reasonable and nec-
essary personal, family, living, or funeral 
expenses that result from a qualified dis-
aster;
2. To reimburse or pay reasonable and nec-
essary expenses incurred for the repair or 
rehabilitation of your home or repair or re-
placement of its contents to the extent it’s 
due to a qualified disaster;
3. By a person engaged in the furnishing or 
sale of transportation as a common carrier 
because of the death or personal physical 
injuries incurred as a result of a qualified 
disaster; or
4. By a federal, state, or local government, 
agency, or instrumentality in connection 
with a qualified disaster in order to pro-
mote the general welfare.
You can exclude this amount only to the extent 
any expense it pays for isn’t paid for by insur-
ance or otherwise. The exclusion doesn’t apply 
if you were a participant or conspirator in a ter-
rorist action or a representative of one.
A qualified disaster is:
•
A disaster which results from a terrorist or 
military action;
•
A federally declared disaster; or
•
A disaster which results from an accident 
involving a common carrier, or from any 
other event, which is determined to be 
catastrophic by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury or his or her delegate.
For amounts paid under item (4) above, a 
disaster is qualified if it’s determined by an ap-
plicable federal, state, or local authority to war-
rant assistance from the federal, state, or local 
government, agency, or instrumentality.
Disaster mitigation payments. You can ex-
clude from income any amount you receive 
that’s a qualified disaster mitigation payment. 
Qualified disaster mitigation payments are most 
commonly paid to you in the period immediately 
following damage to property as a result of a 
natural disaster. However, disaster mitigation 
payments are used to mitigate (reduce the se-
verity of) potential damage from future natural 
disasters. They’re paid to you through state and 
local governments based on the provisions of 
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and 
Emergency Assistance Act or the National 
Flood Insurance Act.
You can’t increase the basis or adjusted ba-
sis of your property for improvements made 
with nontaxable disaster mitigation payments.
Home Affordable Modification Program 
(HAMP). If you benefit from Pay-for-Perform-
ance Success Payments under HAMP, the pay-
ments aren’t taxable.
Mortgage assistance payments under sec-
tion 235 of the National Housing Act. Pay-
ments made under section 235 of the National 
Housing Act for mortgage assistance aren’t in-
cluded in the homeowner's income. Interest 
paid for the homeowner under the mortgage as-
sistance program can’t be deducted.
Medicare. Medicare benefits received under ti-
tle XVIII of the Social Security Act aren’t includi-
ble in the gross income of the individuals for 
whom they’re paid. This includes basic (Part A 
(Hospital Insurance Benefits for the Aged)) and 
supplementary (Part B (Supplementary Medical 
Insurance Benefits for the Aged)).
Social 
security 
benefits 
(including 
lump-sum payments attributable to prior 
years), Supplemental Security Income (SSI) 
benefits, and lump-sum death benefits. The 
Social Security Administration (SSA) provides 
benefits such as old-age benefits, benefits to 
disabled workers, and benefits to spouses and 
dependents. These benefits may be subject to 
federal income tax depending on your filing sta-
tus and other income. See chapter 7 in this pub-
lication and Pub. 915, Social Security and 
Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits, for 
more information. An individual originally de-
nied benefits, but later approved, may receive a 
lump-sum payment for the period when benefits 
were denied (which may be prior years). See 
Pub. 915 for information on how to make a 
lump-sum election, which may reduce your tax 
liability. There are also other types of benefits 
paid by the SSA. However, SSI benefits and 
lump-sum death benefits (one-time payment to 
spouse and children of deceased) aren’t sub-
ject to federal income tax. For more information 
on these benefits, go to SSA.gov.
Nutrition Program for the Elderly. Food ben-
efits you receive under the Nutrition Program for 
the Elderly aren’t taxable. If you prepare and 
serve free meals for the program, include in 
your income as wages the cash pay you re-
ceive, even if you’re also eligible for food bene-
fits.
Payments to reduce cost of winter energy. 
Payments made by a state to qualified people 
to reduce their cost of winter energy use aren’t 
taxable.
Other Income
The following brief discussions are arranged in 
alphabetical order. Other income items briefly 
discussed below are referenced to publications 
which provide more topical information.
Activity not for profit. You must include on 
your return income from an activity from which 
you don’t expect to make a profit. An example 
of this type of activity is a hobby or a farm you 
operate mostly for recreation and pleasure. En-
ter this income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), 
line 8j. Deductions for expenses related to the 
activity are limited. They can’t total more than 
the income you report and can be taken only if 
you itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 
1040). See Not-for-Profit Activities in chapter 1 
of Pub. 535 for information on whether an activ-
ity is considered carried on for a profit.
Alaska Permanent Fund dividend. If you re-
ceived a payment from Alaska's mineral income 
fund (Alaska Permanent Fund dividend), report 
it as income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), 
line 8g. The state of Alaska sends each recipi-
ent a document that shows the amount of the 
payment with the check. The amount is also re-
ported to the IRS.
Alimony. Include in your income on Schedule 
1 (Form 1040), line 2a, any taxable alimony 
payments you receive. Amounts you receive for 
child support aren’t income to you. Alimony and 
child support payments are discussed in Pub. 
504.
Don’t include alimony payments you 
receive under a divorce or separation 
agreement (1) executed after 2018, or 
(2) executed before 2019 but later modified if 
the modification expressly states the repeal of 
the deduction for alimony payments applies to 
the modification.
Bribes. If you receive a bribe, include it in your 
income.
Campaign 
contributions. These 
contribu-
tions aren’t income to a candidate unless 
they’re diverted to her or his personal use. To 
be nontaxable, the contributions must be spent 
for campaign purposes or kept in a fund for use 
in future campaigns. However, interest earned 
on bank deposits, dividends received on con-
tributed securities, and net gains realized on 
sales of contributed securities are taxable and 
must be reported on Form 1120-POL, U.S. In-
come Tax Return for Certain Political Organiza-
tions. Excess campaign funds transferred to an 
office account must be included in the office-
holder's income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), 
line 8z, in the year transferred.
Carpools. Don’t 
include 
in 
your 
income 
amounts you receive from the passengers for 
driving a car in a carpool to and from work. 
These amounts are considered reimbursement 
for your expenses. However, this rule doesn’t 
apply if you have developed carpool arrange-
ments into a profit-making business of trans-
porting workers for hire.
Cash rebates. A cash rebate you receive from 
a dealer or manufacturer of an item you buy 
isn’t income, but you must reduce your basis by 
the amount of the rebate.
Example. You buy a new car for $24,000 
cash and receive a $2,000 rebate check from 
the manufacturer. The $2,000 isn’t income to 
you. Your basis in the car is $22,000. This is the 
basis on which you figure gain or loss if you sell 
the car and depreciation if you use it for busi-
ness.
Casualty insurance and other reimburse-
ments. You generally shouldn’t report these 
reimbursements on your return unless you’re 
figuring gain or loss from the casualty or theft. 
See Pub. 547 for more information.
Child support payments. You shouldn’t re-
port these payments on your return. See Pub. 
504 for more information.
Court awards and damages. To determine if 
settlement amounts you receive by compromise 
or judgment must be included in your income, 
you must consider the item that the settlement 
replaces. The character of the income as ordi-
nary income or capital gain depends on the na-
ture of the underlying claim. Include the follow-
ing as ordinary income.
CAUTION
!
Chapter 8 Other Income Page 71

1. Interest on any award.
2. Compensation for lost wages or lost profits 
in most cases.
3. Punitive damages, in most cases. It 
doesn’t matter if they relate to a physical 
injury or physical sickness.
4. Amounts received in settlement of pension 
rights (if you didn’t contribute to the plan).
5. Damages for:
a. Patent or copyright infringement,
b. Breach of contract, or
c. Interference with business operations.
6. Back pay and damages for emotional dis-
tress received to satisfy a claim under title 
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
7. Attorney fees and costs (including contin-
gent fees) where the underlying recovery 
is included in gross income.
8. Attorney fees and costs relating to whistle-
blower awards where the underlying re-
covery is included in gross income.
Don’t include in your income compensatory 
damages for personal physical injury or physi-
cal sickness (whether received in a lump sum or 
installments).
Emotional distress. Emotional distress it-
self isn’t a physical injury or physical sickness, 
but damages you receive for emotional distress 
due to a physical injury or sickness are treated 
as received for the physical injury or sickness. 
Don’t include them in your income.
If the emotional distress is due to a personal 
injury that isn’t due to a physical injury or sick-
ness (for example, employment discrimination 
or injury to reputation), you must include the 
damages in your income, except for any dam-
ages that aren’t more than amounts paid for 
medical care due to that emotional distress. 
Emotional distress includes physical symptoms 
that result from emotional distress, such as 
headaches, insomnia, and stomach disorders.
Credit card insurance. In most cases, if you 
receive benefits under a credit card disability or 
unemployment insurance plan, the benefits are 
taxable to you. These plans make the minimum 
monthly payment on your credit card account if 
you can’t make the payment due to injury, ill-
ness, disability, or unemployment. Report on 
Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z, the amount of 
benefits you received during the year that’s 
more than the amount of the premiums you paid 
during the year.
Down payment assistance. If you purchase a 
home and receive assistance from a nonprofit 
corporation to make the down payment, that as-
sistance isn’t included in your income. If the cor-
poration qualifies as a tax-exempt charitable or-
ganization, the assistance is treated as a gift 
and is included in your basis of the house. If the 
corporation doesn’t qualify, the assistance is 
treated as a rebate or reduction of the purchase 
price and isn’t included in your basis.
Employment agency fees. If you get a job 
through an employment agency, and the fee is 
paid by your employer, the fee isn’t includible in 
your income if you aren’t liable for it. However, if 
you pay it and your employer reimburses you 
for it, it’s includible in your income.
Energy conservation subsidies. You can ex-
clude from gross income any subsidy provided, 
either directly or indirectly, by public utilities for 
the purchase or installation of an energy con-
servation measure for a dwelling unit.
Energy conservation measure. This in-
cludes installations or modifications that are pri-
marily designed to reduce consumption of elec-
tricity 
or 
natural 
gas, 
or 
improve 
the 
management of energy demand.
Dwelling unit. This includes a house, apart-
ment, condominium, mobile home, boat, or sim-
ilar property. If a building or structure contains 
both dwelling and other units, any subsidy must 
be properly allocated.
Estate and trust income. An estate or trust, 
unlike a partnership, may have to pay federal in-
come tax. If you’re a beneficiary of an estate or 
trust, you may be taxed on your share of its in-
come distributed or required to be distributed to 
you. However, there is never a double tax. Es-
tates and trusts file their returns on Form 1041, 
U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts, 
and your share of the income is reported to you 
on Schedule K-1 (Form 1041).
Current income required to be distrib-
uted. If you’re the beneficiary of an estate or 
trust that must distribute all of its current in-
come, you must report your share of the distrib-
utable net income, whether or not you actually 
received it.
Current income not required to be dis-
tributed. If you’re the beneficiary of an estate 
or trust and the fiduciary has the choice of 
whether to distribute all or part of the current in-
come, you must report:
•
All income that’s required to be distributed 
to you, whether or not it’s actually distrib-
uted, plus
•
All other amounts actually paid or credited 
to you,
up to the amount of your share of distributable 
net income.
How to report. Treat each item of income 
the same way that the estate or trust would treat 
it. For example, if a trust's dividend income is 
distributed to you, you report the distribution as 
dividend income on your return. The same rule 
applies to distributions of tax-exempt interest 
and capital gains.
The fiduciary of the estate or trust must tell 
you the type of items making up your share of 
the estate or trust income and any credits 
you’re allowed on your individual income tax re-
turn.
Losses. Losses of estates and trusts gener-
ally aren’t deductible by the beneficiaries.
Grantor trust. Income earned by a grantor 
trust is taxable to the grantor, not the benefi-
ciary, if the grantor keeps certain control over 
the trust. (The grantor is the one who transfer-
red property to the trust.) This rule applies if the 
property (or income from the property) put into 
the trust will or may revert (be returned) to the 
grantor or the grantor's spouse.
Generally, a trust is a grantor trust if the 
grantor has a reversionary interest valued (at 
the date of transfer) at more than 5% of the 
value of the transferred property.
Expenses paid by another. If your personal 
expenses are paid for by another person, such 
as a corporation, the payment may be taxable 
to you depending upon your relationship with 
that person and the nature of the payment. But 
if the payment makes up for a loss caused by 
that person, and only restores you to the posi-
tion you were in before the loss, the payment 
isn’t includible in your income.
Fees for services. Include all fees for your 
services in your income. Examples of these 
fees are amounts you receive for services you 
perform as:
•
A corporate director;
•
An executor, administrator, or personal 
representative of an estate;
•
A manager of a trade or business you op-
erated before declaring chapter 11 bank-
ruptcy;
•
A notary public; or
•
An election precinct official.
Nonemployee compensation. If you aren’t 
an employee and the fees for your services 
from a single payer in the course of the payer's 
trade or business total $600 or more for the 
year, the payer should send you a Form 
1099-NEC. You may need to report your fees 
as self-employment income. See Self-Em-
ployed Persons in chapter 1 for a discussion of 
when you’re considered self-employed.
Corporate director. Corporate director fees 
are self-employment income. Report these pay-
ments on Schedule C (Form 1040).
Personal 
representatives. All 
personal 
representatives must include in their gross in-
come fees paid to them from an estate. If you 
aren’t in the trade or business of being an exec-
utor (for instance, you’re the executor of a 
friend's or relative's estate), report these fees 
on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z. If you’re in 
the trade or business of being an executor, re-
port these fees as self-employment income on 
Schedule C (Form 1040). The fee isn’t includi-
ble in income if it’s waived.
Manager of trade or business for bank-
ruptcy estate.  Include in your income all pay-
ments received from your bankruptcy estate for 
managing or operating a trade or business that 
you operated before you filed for bankruptcy. 
Report this income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), 
line 8z.
Notary public. Report payments for these 
services on Schedule C (Form 1040). These 
payments aren’t subject to self-employment tax. 
See the separate Instructions for Schedule SE 
(Form 1040) for details.
Election precinct official. You should re-
ceive a Form W-2 showing payments for serv-
ices performed as an election official or election 
worker. Report these payments on line 1a of 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
Foster care providers. Generally, payment 
you receive from a state, a political subdivision, 
Page 72 Chapter 8 Other Income

or a qualified foster care placement agency for 
caring for a qualified foster individual in your 
home is excluded from your income. However, 
you must include in your income payment to the 
extent it’s received for the care of more than five 
qualified foster individuals age 19 years or 
older.
A qualified foster individual is a person who:
1. Is living in a foster family home; and
2. Was placed there by:
a. An agency of a state or one of its polit-
ical subdivisions, or
b. A qualified foster care placement 
agency.
Difficulty-of-care 
payments. These 
are 
payments that are designated by the payer as 
compensation for providing the additional care 
that’s required for physically, mentally, or emo-
tionally handicapped qualified foster individuals. 
A state must determine that this compensation 
is needed, and the care for which the payments 
are made must be provided in the foster care 
provider's home in which the qualified foster in-
dividual was placed.
Certain Medicaid waiver payments are trea-
ted as difficulty-of-care payments when re-
ceived by an individual care provider for caring 
for an eligible individual living in the provider's 
home. 
See 
Notice 
2014-7, 
available 
at 
IRS.gov/irb/2014-04_IRB#NOT-2014-7, and re-
lated questions and answers, available at 
IRS.gov/Individuals/Certain-Medicaid-Waiver-
Payments-May-Be-Excludable-From-Income, 
for more information.
You must include in your income diffi-
culty-of-care payments to the extent they’re re-
ceived for more than:
•
10 qualified foster individuals under age 
19, or
•
Five qualified foster individuals age 19 or 
older.
Maintaining space in home. If you’re paid 
to maintain space in your home for emergency 
foster care, you must include the payment in 
your income.
Reporting taxable payments. If you re-
ceive payments that you must include in your 
income and you’re in business as a foster care 
provider, report the payments on Schedule C 
(Form 1040). See Pub. 587, Business Use of 
Your Home, to help you determine the amount 
you can deduct for the use of your home.
Found property. If you find and keep property 
that doesn’t belong to you that has been lost or 
abandoned (treasure trove), it’s taxable to you 
at its fair market value in the first year it’s your 
undisputed possession.
Free tour. If you received a free tour from a 
travel agency for organizing a group of tourists, 
you must include its value in your income. Re-
port the fair market value of the tour on Sched-
ule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z, if you aren’t in the 
trade or business of organizing tours. You can’t 
deduct your expenses in serving as the volun-
tary leader of the group at the group's request. If 
you organize tours as a trade or business, re-
port the tour's value on Schedule C (Form 
1040).
Gambling winnings. You must include your 
gambling winnings in income on Schedule 1 
(Form 1040), line 8b. Winnings from fantasy 
sports leagues are gambling winnings. If you 
itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 
1040), you can deduct gambling losses you had 
during the year, but only up to the amount of 
your winnings. If you’re in the trade or business 
of gambling, use Schedule C (Form 1040).
Lotteries and raffles. Winnings from lotter-
ies and raffles are gambling winnings. In addi-
tion to cash winnings, you must include in your 
income the fair market value of bonds, cars, 
houses, and other noncash prizes.
If you win a state lottery prize payable 
in installments, see Pub. 525 for more 
information.
Form W-2G. You may have received a Form 
W-2G, Certain Gambling Winnings, showing 
the amount of your gambling winnings and any 
tax taken out of them. Include the amount from 
box 1 on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8b. In-
clude the amount shown in box 4 on Form 1040 
or 1040-SR, line 25c, as federal income tax 
withheld.
Reporting winnings and recordkeeping. 
For more information on reporting gambling 
winnings and recordkeeping, see Gambling 
Losses up to the Amount of Gambling Winnings 
in chapter 12.
Gifts and inheritances. In most cases, prop-
erty you receive as a gift, bequest, or inheri-
tance isn’t included in your income. However, if 
property you receive this way later produces in-
come such as interest, dividends, or rents, that 
income is taxable to you. If property is given to 
a trust and the income from it is paid, credited, 
or distributed to you, that income is also taxable 
to you. If the gift, bequest, or inheritance is the 
income from the property, that income is taxa-
ble to you.
Inherited pension or individual retire-
ment arrangement (IRA). If you inherited a 
pension or an IRA, you may have to include part 
of the inherited amount in your income. See 
Survivors and Beneficiaries in Pub. 575 if you 
inherited a pension. See What if You Inherit an 
IRA? in Pubs. 590-A and 590-B if you inherited 
an IRA.
Hobby losses. Losses from a hobby aren’t de-
ductible from other income. A hobby is an activ-
ity from which you don’t expect to make a profit. 
See Activity not for profit, earlier.
If you collect stamps, coins, or other 
items as a hobby for recreation and 
pleasure, and you sell any of the items, 
your gain is taxable as a capital gain. (See Pub. 
550.) However, if you sell items from your col-
lection at a loss, you can’t deduct the loss.
Illegal activities. Income from illegal activities, 
such as money from dealing illegal drugs, must 
be included in your income on Schedule 1 
(Form 1040), line 8z, or on Schedule C (Form 
1040) if from your self-employment activity.
Indian fishing rights. If you’re a member of a 
qualified Indian tribe that has fishing rights se-
cured by treaty, Executive order, or an Act of 
Congress as of March 17, 1988, don’t include in 
TIP
CAUTION
!
your income amounts you receive from activi-
ties related to those fishing rights. The income 
isn’t subject to income tax, self-employment 
tax, or employment taxes.
Interest on frozen deposits. In general, you 
exclude from your income the amount of inter-
est earned on a frozen deposit. See Interest in-
come on frozen deposits in chapter 6.
Interest on qualified savings bonds. You 
may be able to exclude from income the interest 
from qualified U.S. savings bonds you redeem if 
you pay qualified higher education expenses in 
the same year. For more information on this ex-
clusion, see Education Savings Bond Program 
under U.S. Savings Bonds in chapter 6.
Job interview expenses. If a prospective em-
ployer asks you to appear for an interview and 
either pays you an allowance or reimburses you 
for your transportation and other travel expen-
ses, the amount you receive is generally not 
taxable. You include in income only the amount 
you receive that’s more than your actual expen-
ses.
Jury duty. Jury duty pay you receive must be 
included in your income on Schedule 1 (Form 
1040), line 8h. If you gave any of your jury duty 
pay to your employer because your employer 
continued to pay you while you served jury duty, 
include the amount you gave your employer as 
an income adjustment on Schedule 1 (Form 
1040), line 24a, and see the instructions there.
Kickbacks. You must include kickbacks, side 
commissions, push money, or similar payments 
you receive in your income on Schedule 1 
(Form 1040), line 8z, or on Schedule C (Form 
1040) if from your self-employment activity.
Example. You sell cars and help arrange 
car insurance for buyers. Insurance brokers pay 
back part of their commissions to you for refer-
ring customers to them. You must include the 
kickbacks in your income.
Medical savings accounts (Archer MSAs 
and Medicare Advantage MSAs). In most ca-
ses, you don’t include in income amounts you 
withdraw from your Archer MSA or Medicare 
Advantage MSA if you use the money to pay for 
qualified medical expenses. Generally, qualified 
medical expenses are those you can deduct on 
Schedule A (Form 1040). For more information 
about qualified medical expenses, see Pub. 
502. For more information about Archer MSAs 
or Medicare Advantage MSAs, see Pub. 969, 
Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Fa-
vored Health Plans.
Prizes and awards. If you win a prize in a 
lucky number drawing, television or radio quiz 
program, beauty contest, or other event, you 
must include it in your income. For example, if 
you win a $50 prize in a photography contest, 
you must report this income on Schedule 1 
(Form 1040), line 8i. If you refuse to accept a 
prize, don’t include its value in your income.
Prizes and awards in goods or services 
must be included in your income at their fair 
market value.
Employee 
awards 
or 
bonuses. Cash 
awards or bonuses given to you by your em-
ployer for good work or suggestions must gen-
erally be included in your income as wages. 
Chapter 8 Other Income Page 73

However, certain noncash employee achieve-
ment awards can be excluded from income. 
See Bonuses and awards in chapter 5.
Pulitzer, Nobel, and similar prizes. If you 
were awarded a prize in recognition of accom-
plishments in religious, charitable, scientific, ar-
tistic, educational, literary, or civic fields, you 
must generally include the value of the prize in 
your income. However, you don’t include this 
prize in your income if you meet all of the follow-
ing requirements.
•
You were selected without any action on 
your part to enter the contest or proceed-
ing.
•
You aren’t required to perform substantial 
future services as a condition to receiving 
the prize or award.
•
The prize or award is transferred by the 
payer directly to a governmental unit or 
tax-exempt charitable organization as des-
ignated by you.
See Pub. 525 for more information about the 
conditions that apply to the transfer.
Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF). Effective 
December 22, 2017, Code section 1400Z-2 
provides a temporary deferral on inclusion in 
gross income for capital gains invested in 
QOFs, and permanent exclusion of capital 
gains from the sale or exchange of an invest-
ment in the QOF if the investment is held for at 
least 10 years. See the Instructions for Form 
8949 on how to report your election to defer eli-
gible gains invested in a QOF. See the instruc-
tions for Form 8997, Initial and Annual State-
ment of Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) 
Investments, for reporting information. For addi-
tional information, see Opportunity Zones Fre-
quently 
Asked 
Questions 
at 
IRS.gov/
Newsroom/Opportunity-Zones-Frequently-
Asked-Questions.
Qualified tuition programs (QTPs). A QTP 
(also known as a 529 program) is a program set 
up to allow you to either prepay or contribute to 
an account established for paying a student's 
qualified higher education expenses at an eligi-
ble educational institution. A program can be 
established and maintained by a state, an 
agency or instrumentality of a state, or an eligi-
ble educational institution.
The part of a distribution representing the 
amount paid or contributed to a QTP isn’t inclu-
ded in income. This is a return of the investment 
in the program.
In most cases, the beneficiary doesn’t in-
clude in income any earnings distributed from a 
QTP if the total distribution is less than or equal 
to adjusted qualified higher education expen-
ses. See Pub. 970 for more information.
Railroad retirement annuities. The following 
types of payments are treated as pension or an-
nuity income and are taxable under the rules 
explained in Pub. 575, Pension and Annuity In-
come.
•
Tier 1 railroad retirement benefits that are 
more than the social security equivalent 
benefit.
•
Tier 2 benefits.
•
Vested dual benefits.
Rewards. If you receive a reward for providing 
information, include it in your income.
Sale of home. You may be able to exclude 
from income all or part of any gain from the sale 
or exchange of your main home. See Pub. 523.
Sale of personal items. If you sold an item 
you owned for personal use, such as a car, re-
frigerator, furniture, stereo, jewelry, or silver-
ware, your gain is taxable as a capital gain. Re-
port it as explained in the Instructions for 
Schedule D (Form 1040). You can’t deduct a 
loss.
However, if you sold an item you held for in-
vestment, such as gold or silver bullion, coins, 
or gems, any gain is taxable as a capital gain 
and any loss is deductible as a capital loss.
Example. You sold a painting on an online 
auction website for $100. You bought the paint-
ing for $20 at a garage sale years ago. Report 
your gain as a capital gain as explained in the 
Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040).
Scholarships and fellowships. A candidate 
for a degree can exclude amounts received as 
a qualified scholarship or fellowship. A qualified 
scholarship or fellowship is any amount you re-
ceive that’s for:
•
Tuition and fees to enroll at or attend an 
educational institution; or
•
Fees, books, supplies, and equipment re-
quired for courses at the educational insti-
tution.
Amounts used for room and board don’t qualify 
for the exclusion. See Pub. 970 for more infor-
mation on qualified scholarships and fellowship 
grants.
Payment for services. In most cases, you 
must include in income the part of any scholar-
ship or fellowship that represents payment for 
past, present, or future teaching, research, or 
other services. This applies even if all candi-
dates for a degree must perform the services to 
receive the degree.
For information about the rules that apply to 
a tax-free qualified tuition reduction provided to 
employees and their families by an educational 
institution, see Pub. 970.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) pay-
ments. Allowances paid by the VA aren’t inclu-
ded in your income. These allowances aren’t 
considered scholarship or fellowship grants.
Prizes. Scholarship prizes won in a contest 
aren’t scholarships or fellowships if you don’t 
have to use the prizes for educational purpo-
ses. You must include these amounts in your in-
come on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8i, 
whether or not you use the amounts for educa-
tional purposes.
Sharing/gig economy. Generally, if you work 
in the gig economy or did gig work, you must in-
clude all income received from all jobs whether 
you received a Form 1099-K, Payment Card 
and Third-Party Network Transactions, or not. 
See the Instructions for Schedule C (Form 
1040) and the Instructions for Schedule SE 
(Form 1040).
Stolen property. If you steal property, you 
must report its fair market value in your income 
in the year you steal it unless you return it to its 
rightful owner in the same year.
Transporting school children. Don’t include 
in your income a school board mileage allow-
ance for taking children to and from school if 
you aren’t in the business of taking children to 
school. You can’t deduct expenses for provid-
ing this transportation.
Union benefits and dues. Amounts deducted 
from your pay for union dues, assessments, 
contributions, or other payments to a union 
can’t be excluded from your income.
Strike and lockout benefits. Benefits paid 
to you by a union as strike or lockout benefits, 
including both cash and the fair market value of 
other property, are usually included in your in-
come as compensation. You can exclude these 
benefits from your income only when the facts 
clearly show that the union intended them as 
gifts to you.
Utility rebates. If you’re a customer of an elec-
tric utility company and you participate in the 
utility's energy conservation program, you may 
receive on your monthly electric bill either:
•
A reduction in the purchase price of elec-
tricity furnished to you (rate reduction), or
•
A nonrefundable credit against the pur-
chase price of the electricity.
The amount of the rate reduction or nonrefund-
able credit isn’t included in your income.
