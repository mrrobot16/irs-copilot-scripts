<h3>Key Updates</h3>
<p>For 2023, the social security tax rate is 6.2% each for the employer and employee (12.4% total), with a wage base limit of $160,200. The Medicare tax rate remains at 1.45% each for the employee and employer, with no wage base limit. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 increased the election amount for the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities to $500,000 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022.</p>

<h3>Filing Requirements</h3>
<p>Employers must file Form 941 quarterly and report their tax liability according to their deposit schedule (monthly or semiweekly). If the total taxes after adjustments and nonrefundable credits are less than $2,500 for the quarter, or if the prior quarter's liability was less than $2,500, employers may pay the amount with the return instead of making deposits.</p>

<h3>Penalties and Interest</h3>
<p>Employers can avoid penalties and interest by depositing or paying taxes when due, filing a complete and timely return, reporting tax liability accurately, submitting valid checks for tax payments, furnishing accurate Forms W-2 to employees, and filing Forms W-2 and W-3 with the SSA on time and accurately.</p>

<h3>Adjustments</h3>
<p>Adjustments for fractions of cents, sick pay, tips, and group-term life insurance must be made to calculate the correct tax liability for the quarter.</p>

<h3>Credits</h3>
<p>Employers may be eligible for credits such as the qualified small business payroll tax credit for increasing research activities and the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages.</p>

<h3>Final Return</h3>
<p>If a business closes or stops paying wages, a final return must be filed by checking the box on line 17 and entering the final date wages were paid.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Designee</h3>
<p>Employers can designate a third party to discuss their Form 941 with the IRS by checking the "Yes" box in Part 4 and providing the designee's information.</p>

<h3>Signature Requirements</h3>
