<h3>General Instructions</h3>
<p>Employers use Form 8994 to figure out the credit for paid family and medical leave. Partnerships and S corporations must file this form to claim the credit, while other taxpayers should not file if their only source for this credit is a partnership or S corporation; instead, they should report it on Form 3800.</p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<p>An eligible employer must have a written policy in place that offers paid family and medical leave and satisfies minimum paid leave requirements. This includes providing non-interference language if the employer has any qualifying employees not covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).</p>

<h3>Qualifying Employee</h3>
<p>A qualifying employee is one who has been employed for at least one year and whose previous year's compensation does not exceed certain thresholds.</p>

<h3>Family and Medical Leave</h3>
<p>Leave must be for FMLA purposes, and if paid leave is also available for non-FMLA purposes, it is not considered family and medical leave.</p>

<h3>Minimum Paid Leave Requirements</h3>
<p>The policy must provide at least two weeks of paid leave to full-time qualifying employees (proportionate for part-time) and pay at least 50% of the wages normally paid.</p>

<h3>How To Figure the Credit</h3>
<p>The credit is based on the applicable percentage of wages paid to qualifying employees during leave, up to a maximum of 12 weeks per tax year. Wages used for other credits cannot be used for this credit.</p>

<h3>Specific Instructions</h3>
<p>Employers need to answer questions about their policies and whether they paid family and medical leave to at least one qualifying employee. The form includes a worksheet to calculate the credit amount, which must be reported on the tax return. The credit must be claimed within three years from the return's due date.</p>
