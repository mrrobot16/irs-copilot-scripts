<h2>Summary of Instructions for Form 965-C (December 2019)</h2>

<p>The <b>Instructions for Form 965-C</b> provide guidance for taxpayers who need to enter into a transfer agreement under section 965(h)(3) due to certain acceleration events. This form is used when a taxpayer elects to pay a tax liability, specifically under section 965(a), in installments over eight years, and a transfer of liability is needed due to a change in ownership or similar event.</p>
