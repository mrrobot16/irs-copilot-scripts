</p>

<h3>What's New</h3>
<p>
    The repayment period for qualified 2018 disaster distributions ends 3 years and 1 day after the distribution was received. Repayments reported on the 2022 Form 8915-C can reduce income reported on 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022 tax returns. If you've already filed for the year in question, you'll need to amend that return.
</p>

<h3>Coronavirus-Related Distributions</h3>
<p>
    Repayments for coronavirus-related distributions made in 2022 should not be reported on Form 8915-C. Instead, use Form 8915-F.
</p>

<h3>Purpose of Form</h3>
<p>
    Form 8915-C is used for reporting income from qualified 2018 disaster distributions taken in 2020 that are spread over 3 years and for reporting repayments made in 2022 that were not included on your 2021 Form 8915-C.
</p>

<h3>Who Must File</h3>
<p>
    You must file Form 8915-C if you received a qualified 2018 disaster distribution in 2020 that you're including in income over 3 years, or if you made a repayment of such a distribution in 2022.
</p>

<h3>When and Where To File</h3>
<p>
    File Form 8915-C with your 2022 Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. If you're not required to file an income tax return but must file Form 8915-C, send it to the IRS at the same time and place you would file your tax return.
</p>

<h3>Qualified 2018 Disaster Distribution</h3>
<p>
    To have a qualified 2018 disaster distribution, you must have been affected by a disaster listed in Table 1 at the end of the instructions. The distribution is generally included in income over 3 years unless you elected to include the entire distribution in the year it was received. Qualified 2018 disaster distributions are not subject to the 10% additional tax on early distributions.
</p>

<h3>Repayment of a Qualified 2018 Disaster Distribution</h3>
<p>
    Repayments must be made within 3 years and 1 day after the distribution was received and cannot exceed the original distribution amount. Repayments are treated as a trustee-to-trustee transfer and are not included in income.
</p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Qualified 2018 disaster distributions received as a beneficiary (other than a surviving spouse).</li>
    <li>Required minimum distributions.</li>
    <li>Periodic payments made for 10 years or more, or for life expectancy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Amending Form 8915-C</h3>
<p>
    If you need to amend a return to claim a repayment, file Form 1040-X. The timing of your repayments determines if you need to file an amended return.
