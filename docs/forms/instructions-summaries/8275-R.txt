<h2>Summary of Instructions for Form 8275-R (Rev. January 2021)</h2>
<p>Form 8275-R, titled <q>Regulation Disclosure Statement,</q> is used to disclose positions taken on a tax return that are contrary to Treasury regulations. This disclosure can help taxpayers and tax return preparers avoid parts of the accuracy-related penalty due to disregard of regulations or substantial understatement of income tax for non-tax shelter items, provided the return position has a reasonable basis. It's also applicable for disclosures related to the economic substance penalty and preparer penalties for tax understatements due to contrary positions.</p>
