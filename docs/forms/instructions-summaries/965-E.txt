<h2>Summary of Instructions for Form 965-E (December 2019)</h2>

<p>Form 965-E is a consent agreement form used by S corporation shareholders to obtain consent to make a section 965(h) election for payment of a net tax liability under section 965(i) following certain triggering events. This form is required due to the amendments to section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code made on December 22, 2017. These amendments require certain taxpayers to include deferred foreign income of specified foreign corporations in their income.</p>

<p>Specifically, shareholders of S corporations may defer payment of their section 965(i) net tax liability until a triggering event occurs, after which they can elect to pay in installments over 8 years. However, for certain triggering events related to the S corporation's substantial asset dispositions or cessation of business, shareholders must obtain the consent of the Commissioner to make the section 965(h) election.</p>
