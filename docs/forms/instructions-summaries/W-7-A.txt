<h2>Summary of Instructions for Form W-7A (Rev. October 2017)</h2>
<p>Form W-7A is used to apply for an IRS Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number (ATIN) for a child in pending U.S. adoptions. This form is for individuals who are in the process of legally adopting a U.S. citizen or resident alien child and cannot obtain a Social Security Number (SSN) for the child in time to file their tax return.</p>

<h3>Purpose and Use</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An ATIN is a temporary number used to claim certain tax benefits related to the child being adopted.</li>
  <li>Do not use Form W-7A if the child is not a U.S. citizen or resident alien, or if an SSN can be obtained in time for tax filing.</li>
  <li>Benefits that can be claimed with an ATIN include dependency exemption, child and dependent care expenses, adoption credit, and child tax credit (but not the earned income credit).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Validity and Expiration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An ATIN is valid for 2 years from the date of issuance.</li>
  <li>If the adoption is not finalized by the expiration date, you may apply for an extension.</li>
  <li>Once the adoption is final, you must obtain an SSN for the child and use that instead of the ATIN.</li>
</ul>
