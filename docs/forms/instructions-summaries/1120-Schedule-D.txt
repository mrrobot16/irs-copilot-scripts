<h3>Who Must File</h3>
<p>Corporations must attach Schedule D to their tax return if they have capital asset transactions, capital gain distributions, or need to report a capital loss carryover.</p>

<h3>Other Forms to File</h3>

<h3>Capital Assets</h3>

<h3>Capital Losses</h3>
<p>Capital losses are limited to the extent of capital gains with a carryback of 3 years and carryforward of up to 5 years.</p>
