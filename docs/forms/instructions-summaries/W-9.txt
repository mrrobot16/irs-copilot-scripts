<h3>Usage of Form W-9</h3>

<h3>Electronic Submission of Forms W-9</h3>
<p>Forms W-9 can be submitted electronically, including by fax, if certain requirements are met.</p>

<h3>Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)</h3>
<p>For individuals who cannot obtain a Social Security Number (SSN), an ITIN should be used and provided on Form W-9.</p>

<h3>Substitute Form W-9</h3>
<p>Requesters may develop a substitute Form W-9 if it is substantially similar to the IRS Form W-9 and meets certification requirements.</p>

<h3>TIN Applied For</h3>
<p>If a payee has applied for a TIN, they can submit Form W-9 with "Applied For" written in Part I, but backup withholding may apply if a TIN is not provided within 60 days.</p>

<h3>Payees Exempt From Backup Withholding</h3>
<p>Certain payees, such as tax-exempt organizations and government entities, are exempt from backup withholding. They should indicate their exempt status on Form W-9.</p>

<h3>Payments Exempt From Backup Withholding</h3>
<p>Some payments, like wages and certain distributions, are not subject to backup withholding.</p>

<h3>Payees and Account Holders Exempt From FATCA Reporting</h3>
<p>U.S. persons are generally not subject to FATCA reporting by U.S. financial institutions.</p>

<h3>Names and TINs To Use for Information Reporting</h3>
<p>The full name and address as provided on Form W-9 should be used for information reporting to the IRS and provided to the payee.</p>

<h3>Notices From the IRS</h3>
<p>The IRS sends notices if the payee's name and TIN do not match IRS records. Requesters may need to solicit a new TIN from the payee.</p>

<h3>Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) Matching</h3>
<p>TIN Matching allows payers to verify TIN and name combinations with IRS records to avoid backup withholding notices.</p>
