<p>Use your 2022 tax return as a guide for your 2023 tax, but consider the changes mentioned above. Specific instructions are provided for former U.S. citizens and long-term residents who expatriate, as well as for foreign students on certain visas with regards to social security or Medicare taxes withheld in error.</p>

<h3>Purpose of Form</h3>
<p>Form 1040-C must be filed before an alien leaves the United States or any of its possessions. Nonresident aliens should use the 2022 Instructions for Form 1040-NR, while resident aliens should use the 2022 Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR to help complete Form 1040-C.</p>

<h3>Final Return Required</h3>
<p>A Form 1040-C is not a final return. A final income tax return must be filed after the tax year ends.</p>

<h3>Certificate of Compliance</h3>
<p>The issuance of a certificate of compliance does not finalize your tax liability. If additional tax is owed, it must be paid.</p>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>Some individuals, such as representatives of a foreign government, certain students, trainees, and teachers, do not need a certificate of compliance.</p>

<h3>How To Get the Certificate</h3>
<p>Aliens should not leave the United States without obtaining a certificate of compliance on Form 1040-C or Form 2063. To get a certificate, file Form 1040-C or Form 2063 with your local IRS office before departure. Pay all tax shown as due and any taxes due for past years.</p>
