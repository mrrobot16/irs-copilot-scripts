Return You’re Correcting...
Enter the calendar year of the return 
you’re correcting:
(YYYY)
Enter the date you discovered errors:
/
/
(MM / DD / YYYY)
Read the separate instructions before completing this form. Use this form to correct errors you made on Form 943, Employer’s Annual Federal 
Tax Return for Agricultural Employees. Use a separate Form 943-X for each year that needs correction. Type or print within the boxes. You 
MUST complete all five pages. Don’t attach this form to Form 943 unless you’re reclassifying workers; see the instructions for line 40.
Part 1: Select ONLY one process. See page 6 for additional guidance, including information on how to treat 
employment tax credits and social security tax deferrals.
1.  Adjusted employment tax return. Check this box if you underreported tax amounts. Also check this box if you overreported tax 
amounts and you would like to use the adjustment process to correct the errors. You must check this box if you’re correcting both 
underreported and overreported tax amounts on this form. The amount shown on line 25, if less than zero, may only be applied as 
a credit to your Form 943 for the tax period in which you’re filing this form.
2.  Claim. Check this box if you overreported tax amounts only and you would like to use the claim process to ask for a refund or 
abatement of the amount shown on line 25. Don’t check this box if you’re correcting ANY underreported tax amounts on this form.
Part 2: Complete the certifications.
3.  I certify that I’ve filed or will file Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, or Forms W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, 
as required.
Note: If you’re correcting underreported tax amounts only, go to Part 3 on page 2 and skip lines 4 and 5. If you’re correcting overreported 
tax amounts, for purposes of the certifications on lines 4 and 5, Medicare tax doesn’t include Additional Medicare Tax. Form 943-X can’t 
be used to correct overreported amounts of Additional Medicare Tax unless the amounts weren’t withheld from employee wages.
4.  If you checked line 1 because you’re adjusting overreported federal income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, or 
Additional Medicare Tax, check all that apply. You must check at least one box. 
I certify that:
a.  I repaid or reimbursed each affected employee for the overcollected social security tax and Medicare tax for prior years. I 
have a written statement from each affected employee stating that they haven’t claimed (or the claim was rejected) and won’t 
claim a refund or credit for the overcollection.
b.  The adjustments of social security tax and Medicare tax are for the employer’s share only. I couldn’t find the affected 
employees or each affected employee didn’t give me a written statement that they haven’t claimed (or the claim was rejected) 
and won’t claim a refund or credit for the overcollection.
c.  The adjustment is for federal income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, or Additional Medicare Tax that I didn’t withhold 
from employee wages.
5.  If you checked line 2 because you’re claiming a refund or abatement of overreported federal income tax, social security 
tax, Medicare tax, or Additional Medicare Tax, check all that apply. You must check at least one box. 
I certify that:
a.  I repaid or reimbursed each affected employee for the overcollected social security tax and Medicare tax for prior years. I 
have a written statement from each affected employee stating that they haven’t claimed (or the claim was rejected) and won’t 
claim a refund or credit for the overcollection.
b.  I have a written consent from each affected employee stating that I may file this claim for the employee’s share of social 
security tax and Medicare tax overcollected in prior years. I also have a written statement from each affected employee 
stating that they haven’t claimed (or the claim was rejected) and won’t claim a refund or credit for the overcollection.
c.  The claim for social security tax and Medicare tax is for the employer’s share only. I couldn’t find the affected employees; or 
each affected employee didn’t give me a written consent to file a claim for the employee’s share of social security tax and 
Medicare tax; or each affected employee didn’t give me a written statement that they haven’t claimed (or the claim was 
rejected) and won’t claim a refund or credit for the overcollection.
d.  The claim is for federal income tax, social security tax, Medicare tax, or Additional Medicare Tax that I didn’t withhold from 
employee wages.
