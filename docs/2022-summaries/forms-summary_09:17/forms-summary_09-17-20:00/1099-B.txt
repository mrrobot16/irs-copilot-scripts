Form 1099-B

www.irs.gov/Form1099B
Instructions for Recipient
Brokers and barter exchanges must report proceeds from (and in 
some cases, basis for) transactions to you and the IRS on Form  
1099-B. Reporting is also required when your broker knows or has 
reason to know that a corporation in which you own stock has had a 
reportable change in control or capital structure. You may be required 
to recognize gain from the receipt of cash, stock, or other property 
that was exchanged for the corporation’s stock. If your broker 
reported this type of transaction to you, the corporation is identified in 
box 1a.
Recipient’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your 
protection, this form may show only the last four digits of your TIN 
(social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification 
number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or 
employer identification number (EIN)). However, the issuer has 
reported your complete TIN to the IRS.
Account number. May show an account or other unique number the 
payer assigned to distinguish your account.
CUSIP number. Shows the CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Security 
Identification Procedures) number or other applicable identifying 
number.
FATCA filing requirement. If the FATCA filing requirement box is 
checked, the payer is reporting on this Form 1099 to satisfy its 
account reporting requirement under chapter 4 of the Internal 
Revenue Code. You may also have a filing requirement. See the 
Instructions for Form 8938.
Applicable checkbox on Form 8949. Indicates where to report this 
transaction on Form 8949 and Schedule D (Form 1040), and which 
checkbox is applicable. See the instructions for your Schedule D 
(Form 1040) and/or Form 8949.
Box 1a. Shows a brief description of the item or service for which 
amounts are being reported. For regulated futures contracts and 
forward contracts, “RFC” or other appropriate description may be 
shown. For Section 1256 option contracts, “Section 1256 option” or 
other appropriate description may be shown. For a corporation that 
had a reportable change in control or capital structure, this box may 
show the class of stock as C (common), P (preferred), or O (other).
Box 1b. This box may be blank if box 5 is checked or if the securities 
sold were acquired on a variety of dates. For short sales, the date 
shown is the date you acquired the security delivered to close the 
short sale.
Box 1c. Shows the trade date of the sale or exchange. For short 
sales, the date shown is the date the security was delivered to close 
the short sale. For aggregate reporting in boxes 8 through 11, no entry 
will be present.
Box 1d. Shows the cash proceeds, reduced by any commissions or 
transfer taxes related to the sale, for transactions involving stocks, 
debt, commodities, forward contracts, non-Section 1256 option 
contracts, or securities futures contracts. May show the proceeds 
from the disposition of your interest(s) in a widely held fixed 
investment trust. May also show the aggregate amount of cash and 
the fair market value of any stock or other property received in a 
reportable change in control or capital structure arising from the 
corporate transfer of property to a foreign corporation. Losses on 
forward contracts or non-Section 1256 option contracts are shown in 
parentheses. This box does not include proceeds from regulated 
futures contracts or Section 1256 option contracts. Report this 
amount on Form 8949 or on Schedule D (Form 1040) (whichever is 
applicable) as explained in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 
1040).   
Box 1e. Shows the cost or other basis of securities sold. If the 
securities were acquired through the exercise of a noncompensatory 
option granted or acquired on or after January 1, 2014, the basis has 
been adjusted to reflect your option premium. If the securities were 
acquired through the exercise of a noncompensatory option granted 
or acquired before January 1, 2014, your broker is permitted, but not 
required, to adjust the basis to reflect your option premium. If the 
securities were acquired through the exercise of a compensatory 
option, the basis has not been adjusted to include any amount related 
to the option that was reported to you on a Form W-2. If box 5 is 
checked, box 1e may be blank. See the Instructions for Form 8949, 
the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040), or Pub. 550 for details.

Instructions for Recipient (continued)
Box 1f. Shows the amount of accrued market discount. For details on 
market discount, see the Schedule D (Form 1040) instructions, the 
Instructions for Form 8949, and Pub. 550. If box 5 is checked, box 1f 
may be blank.
Box 1g. Shows the amount of nondeductible loss in a wash sale 
transaction. For details on wash sales, see the Schedule D (Form 
1040) instructions, the Instructions for Form 8949, and Pub. 550. If 
box 5 is checked, box 1g may be blank. 
Box 2. The short-term and long-term boxes pertain to short-term gain 
or loss and long-term gain or loss. If the “Ordinary” box is checked, 
your security may be subject to special rules. For example, gain on a 
contingent payment debt instrument subject to the noncontingent 
bond method is generally treated as ordinary interest income rather 
than as capital gain. See the Instructions for Form 8949, Pub. 550, or 
Pub. 1212 for more details on whether there are any special rules or 
adjustments that might apply to your security. If box 5 is checked, box 
2 may be blank.
Box 3. If checked, proceeds are from a transaction involving 
collectibles or from a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF).
Box 4. Shows backup withholding. Generally, a payer must backup 
withhold if you did not furnish your TIN to the payer. See Form W-9 for 
information on backup withholding. Include this amount on your 
income tax return as tax withheld.
Box 5. If checked, the securities sold were noncovered securities and 
boxes 1b, 1e, 1f, 1g, and 2 may be blank. Generally, a noncovered 
security means (a) stock purchased before 2011, (b) stock in most 
mutual funds purchased before 2012, (c) stock purchased in or 
transferred to a dividend reinvestment plan before 2012, (d) debt 
acquired before 2014, (e) options granted or acquired before 2014, 
and (f) securities futures contracts executed before 2014.
Box 6. If the exercise of a noncompensatory option resulted in a sale 
of a security, a checked “Net proceeds” box indicates whether the 
amount in box 1d was adjusted for option premium. 
Box 7. If checked, you cannot take a loss on your tax return based on 
gross proceeds from a reportable change in control or capital 
structure reported in box 1d. See the Form 8949 and Schedule D 
(Form 1040) instructions. The broker should advise you of any losses 
on a separate statement.
Regulated Futures Contracts, Foreign Currency Contracts, and 
Section 1256 Option Contracts (Boxes 8 Through 11)
Box 8. Shows the profit or (loss) realized on regulated futures, foreign 
currency, or Section 1256 option contracts closed during 2023.
Box 9. Shows any year-end adjustment to the profit or (loss) shown in 
box 8 due to open contracts on December 31, 2022.
Box 10. Shows the unrealized profit or (loss) on open contracts held in 
your account on December 31, 2023. These are considered closed 
out as of that date. This will become an adjustment reported as 
unrealized profit or (loss) on open contracts—12/31/2023 in 2024.
Box 11. Boxes 8, 9, and 10 are all used to figure the aggregate profit 
or (loss) on regulated futures, foreign currency, or Section 1256 option 
contracts for the year. Include this amount on your 2023 Form 6781.
Box 12. If checked, the basis in box 1e has been reported to the IRS 
and either the short-term or the long-term gain or loss box in box 2 
will be checked. If box 12 is checked on Form(s) 1099-B and NO 
adjustment is required, see the instructions for your Schedule D (Form 
1040) as you may be able to report your transaction directly on 
Schedule D (Form 1040). If the “Ordinary” box in box 2 is checked, an 
adjustment may be required.
Box 13. Shows the cash you received, the fair market value of any 
property or services you received, and the fair market value of any 
trade credits or scrip credited to your account by a barter exchange. 
See Pub. 525.
Boxes 14–16. Show state(s)/local income tax information.
