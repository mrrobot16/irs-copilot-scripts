Terms of Agreement
By signing this transfer agreement, you agree to the following.
• This document constitutes an agreement by the transferee to assume the liability of the transferor for the unpaid portion of the 
section 965(i) net tax liability or, in the case of a partial transfer, for the unpaid portion of the section 965(i) net tax liability 
attributable to the transferred stock;
• The transferee agrees to comply with all the conditions and requirements of section 965(i) and Regulations section 1.965-7(c), 
including the annual reporting requirement, as well as any other applicable requirements of the regulations under section 965;
• The transferor and any successor to the transferor will remain jointly and severally liable for the section 965(i) net tax liability being 
assumed by the transferee;
• If the Commissioner requests additional information (for example, additional information regarding the ability of the transferee to 
fully pay the section 965(i) net tax liability), the transferee will provide such information; and
• If the Commissioner determines, at the time of submission or such later date until the section 965(i) net tax liability has been fully 
paid, that this transfer agreement contains a material misrepresentation or material omission, or if the transferee does not provide 
the additional information requested by the Commissioner within a reasonable timeframe communicated by the Commissioner, the 
Commissioner may reject the transfer agreement effective as of the date of the related triggering event or, in the alternative, on the 
date the Commissioner determines that this transfer agreement includes a material misrepresentation or material omission.
