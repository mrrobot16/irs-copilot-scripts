About this schedule
Each year the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) compare the totals on your Forms 941, 
Employer’s QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return, with the totals on Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, to verify that:
• The wages you reported on Forms 941 match those you reported on Forms W-2 (Copy A) so that your 
employees’ social security earnings records are complete for benefit purposes; and
• You have paid the appropriate taxes.
Generally, the totals on your Forms W-2 (Copy A) should equal the totals you reported on Forms 941. Use this schedule if discrepancies 
exist between the totals you reported on those forms ONLY as a result of an acquisition, statutory merger, or consolidation. In many cases, 
the information on this schedule should help the IRS resolve discrepancies without contacting you. If you are an eligible employer 
who elects to use the alternate procedure set forth in Rev. Proc. 2004-53, explained in the instructions, you should file this schedule.
Read the separate instructions before you fill out this schedule.
