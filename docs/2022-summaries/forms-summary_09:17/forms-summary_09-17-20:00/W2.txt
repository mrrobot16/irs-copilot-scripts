Copy B—To Be Filed With Employee’s FEDERAL Tax Return. 
This information is being furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.
Department of the Treasury—Internal Revenue Service
Notice to Employee
Do you have to file? Refer to the Form 1040 instructions to 
determine if you are required to file a tax return. Even if you 
don’t have to file a tax return, you may be eligible for a refund if 
box 2 shows an amount or if you are eligible for any credit. 
Earned income credit (EIC). You may be able to take the EIC 
for 2022 if your adjusted gross income (AGI) is less than a 
certain amount. The amount of the credit is based on income 
and family size. Workers without children could qualify for a 
smaller credit. You and any qualifying children must have valid 
social security numbers (SSNs). You can’t take the EIC if your 
investment income is more than the specified amount for 2022 
or if income is earned for services provided while you were an 
inmate at a penal institution. For 2022 income limits and more 
information, visit www.irs.gov/EITC. See also Pub. 596, Earned 
Income Credit. Any EIC that is more than your tax liability is 
refunded to you, but only if you file a tax return.
Employee’s social security number (SSN). For your 
protection, this form may show only the last four digits of your 
SSN. However, your employer has reported your complete SSN 
to the IRS and the Social Security Administration (SSA).
Clergy and religious workers. If you aren’t subject to social 
security and Medicare taxes, see Pub. 517, Social Security and 
Other Information for Members of the Clergy and Religious 
Workers.
Corrections. If your name, SSN, or address is incorrect, correct 
Copies B, C, and 2 and ask your employer to correct your 
employment record. Be sure to ask the employer to file Form 
W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, with the SSA to 
correct any name, SSN, or money amount error reported to the 
SSA on Form W-2. Be sure to get your copies of Form W-2c 
from your employer for all corrections made so you may file 
them with your tax return. If your name and SSN are correct but 
aren’t the same as shown on your social security card, you 
should ask for a new card that displays your correct name at 
any SSA office or by calling 800-772-1213. You may also visit 
the SSA website at www.SSA.gov.
Cost of employer-sponsored health coverage (if such cost is 
provided by the employer). The reporting in box 12, using 
code DD, of the cost of employer-sponsored health coverage is 
for your information only. The amount reported with code DD 
is not taxable.
Credit for excess taxes. If you had more than one employer in 
2022 and more than $9,114 in social security and/or Tier 1 
railroad retirement (RRTA) taxes were withheld, you may be able 
to claim a credit for the excess against your federal income tax. 
See the Form 1040 instructions. If you had more than one 
railroad employer and more than $5,350.80 in Tier 2 RRTA tax 
was withheld, you may be able to claim a refund on Form 843. 
See the Instructions for Form 843.

Instructions for Employee
(See also Notice to Employee on the back of Copy B.)
Box 1. Enter this amount on the wages line of your tax return. 
Box 2. Enter this amount on the federal income tax withheld line of your 
tax return.
Box 5. You may be required to report this amount on Form 8959, 
Additional Medicare Tax. See the Form 1040 instructions to determine if 
you are required to complete Form 8959.
Box 6. This amount includes the 1.45% Medicare Tax withheld on all 
Medicare wages and tips shown in box 5, as well as the 0.9% Additional 
Medicare Tax on any of those Medicare wages and tips above 
$200,000.
Box 8. This amount is not included in box 1, 3, 5, or 7. For information 
on how to report tips on your tax return, see the Form 1040 instructions.
You must file Form 4137, Social Security and Medicare Tax on 
Unreported Tip Income, with your income tax return to report at least 
the allocated tip amount unless you can prove with adequate records 
that you received a smaller amount. If you have records that show the 
actual amount of tips you received, report that amount even if it is more 
or less than the allocated tips. Use Form 4137 to figure the social 
security and Medicare tax owed on tips you didn’t report to your 
employer. Enter this amount on the wages line of your tax return. By 
filing Form 4137, your social security tips will be credited to your social 
security record (used to figure your benefits).
Box 10. This amount includes the total dependent care benefits that 
your employer paid to you or incurred on your behalf (including amounts 
from a section 125 (cafeteria) plan). Any amount over your employer’s 
plan limit is also included in box 1. See Form 2441.
Box 11. This amount is (a) reported in box 1 if it is a distribution made to 
you from a nonqualified deferred compensation or nongovernmental 
section 457(b) plan, or (b) included in box 3 and/or box 5 if it is a prior 
year deferral under a nonqualified or section 457(b) plan that became 
taxable for social security and Medicare taxes this year because there is 
no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture of your right to the deferred 
amount. This box shouldn’t be used if you had a deferral and a 
distribution in the same calendar year. If you made a deferral and
received a distribution in the same calendar year, and you are or will be 
age 62 by the end of the calendar year, your employer should file Form 
SSA-131, Employer Report of Special Wage Payments, with the Social 
Security Administration and give you a copy.
Box 12. The following list explains the codes shown in box 12. You may 
need this information to complete your tax return. Elective deferrals 
(codes D, E, F, and S) and designated Roth contributions (codes AA, 
BB, and EE) under all plans are generally limited to a total of $20,500 
($14,000 if you only have SIMPLE plans; $23,500 for section 403(b) 
plans if you qualify for the 15-year rule explained in Pub. 571). Deferrals 
under code G are limited to $20,500. Deferrals under code H are limited 
to $7,000.
However, if you were at least age 50 in 2022, your employer may have 
allowed an additional deferral of up to $6,500 ($3,000 for section  
401(k)(11) and 408(p) SIMPLE plans). This additional deferral amount is 
not subject to the overall limit on elective deferrals. For code G, the limit 
on elective deferrals may be higher for the last 3 years before you reach 
retirement age. Contact your plan administrator for more information. 
Amounts in excess of the overall elective deferral limit must be included 
in income. See the Form 1040 instructions.
Note: If a year follows code D through H, S, Y, AA, BB, or EE, you made 
a make-up pension contribution for a prior year(s) when you were in 
military service. To figure whether you made excess deferrals, consider 
these amounts for the year shown, not the current year. If no year is 
shown, the contributions are for the current year.
A—Uncollected social security or RRTA tax on tips. Include this tax on 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR. See the Form 1040 instructions.
B—Uncollected Medicare tax on tips. Include this tax on Form 1040 or 
1040-SR. See the Form 1040 instructions.
C—Taxable cost of group-term life insurance over $50,000 (included in 
boxes 1, 3 (up to the social security wage base), and 5)

Also includes deferrals under a SIMPLE retirement account that is part 
of a section 401(k) arrangement.

Employers, Please Note—
Specific information needed to complete Form W-2 is available 
in a separate booklet titled the 2022 General Instructions for 
Forms W-2 and W-3. You can order these instructions and 
additional forms at www.irs.gov/OrderForms.
Caution: Do not send the SSA any Forms W-2 and W-3 that you 
have printed from IRS.gov. The SSA is unable to process these 
forms. Instead, you can create and submit them online. See 
E-filing, later.
Due dates. By January 31, 2023, furnish Copies B, C, and 2 to 
each person who was your employee during 2022. Mail or 
electronically file Copy A of Form(s) W-2 and W-3 with the SSA 
by January 31, 2023. See the separate instructions.
Need help? If you have questions about reporting on Form W-2, 
call the information reporting customer service site toll free at 
866-455-7438 or 304-263-8700 (not toll free). For TTY/TDD
equipment for persons who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a 
speech disability, call 304-579-4827 (not toll free). 
E-filing. See the 2022 General Instructions for Forms W-2 and 
W-3 for information on when you’re required to file 
electronically. Even if you aren’t required to file electronically, 
doing so can save you time and effort. Employers may now use 
the SSA’s W-2 Online service to create, save, print, and submit 
up to 50 Form(s) W-2 at a time over the Internet. When you e-file 
with the SSA, no separate Form W-3 filing is required. An 
electronic Form W-3 will be created for you by the W-2 Online 
service. For information, visit the SSA’s Employer W-2 Filing 
Instructions & Information website at www.SSA.gov/employer. 
Future developments. Information about any future 
developments affecting Form W-2 and its instructions (such as 
legislation enacted after we release them) will be posted at 
www.irs.gov/FormW2.
