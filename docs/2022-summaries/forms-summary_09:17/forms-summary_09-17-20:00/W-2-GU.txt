Copy B—To Be Filed With Employee’s Guam Tax Return
Notice to Employee
Do you have to file? Refer to the Form 1040 instructions to determine if you are 
required to file a tax return. Even if you don’t have to file a tax return, you may be 
eligible for a refund if box 2 shows an amount or if you are eligible for any credit. 
Copies B and C; corrections. File Copy B of this form with your 2023 Guam 
income tax return. Keep Copy C for your records. If your name, social security 
number (SSN), or address is incorrect, correct Copies B and C and ask your 
employer to correct your employment record. Be sure to ask your employer to file 
Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, with the Social Security 
Administration (SSA) to correct any name, amount, or SSN error reported to the 
SSA. Be sure to get your copies of Form W-2c from your employer for all 
corrections made so you may file them with your tax return.
Estimated tax. If you expect to owe $1,000 or more in tax for 2024, you may have 
to make estimated tax payments to your local territory tax department. You may 
also have to make estimated tax payments to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service if 
you are subject to self-employment taxes. See Pub. 570 for additional information.
Employee’s social security number (SSN). For your protection, this form may 
show only the last four digits of your SSN. However, your employer has reported 
your complete SSN to the Guam Department of Revenue and Taxation and the 
SSA.
Clergy and religious workers. If you aren’t subject to social security and 
Medicare taxes, see Pub. 517.
Cost of employer-sponsored health coverage (if such cost is provided by the 
employer). The reporting in box 12, using code DD, of the cost of employer-
sponsored health coverage is for your information only. The amount reported 
with code DD is not taxable.
Credit for Guam income tax withheld. If you had local territory income tax 
withheld, you are allowed an income tax credit on your income tax return for that 
amount.
Credit for excess social security tax. If you had more than one employer in 2023 
and more than $9,932.40 in social security tax was withheld, you can have the 
excess refunded by filing Form 843, Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement, 
with the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service Center, Austin, TX 
73301-0215, USA. However, if you are required to file Form 1040 or 1040-SR with 
the United States, you must claim the excess tax as a credit on Form 1040 or 
1040-SR.
Unreported tip income. You must file Form 4137 with your income tax return to 
figure the social security and Medicare tax owed on tips you didn’t report to your 
employer. Enter this amount on the wages line of your tax return. (Form 1040-SS 
filers, see the instructions for Form 1040-SS, Part I, line 6.) By filing this form, your 
social security tips will be credited to your social security record (used to figure 
your benefits). 
(See also the Instructions for Employee on this page and the back of Copy C.)
Instructions for Employee
(See also Notice to Employee on this page.)
Box 5. You may be required to report this amount on Form 8959. See the Form 
1040 instructions to determine if you are required to complete Form 8959.
Box 6. This amount includes the 1.45% Medicare tax withheld on all Medicare 
wages and tips shown in box 5, as well as the 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax on 
any of those Medicare wages and tips above $200,000. 
Box 11. This amount is (a) reported in box 1 if it is a distribution made to you from 
a nonqualified deferred compensation or nongovernmental section 457(b) plan, or 
(b) included in box 3 and/or box 5 if it is a prior year deferral under a nonqualified or 
section 457(b) plan that became taxable for social security and Medicare taxes this 
year because there is no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture of your right to the 
deferred amount. This box shouldn’t be used if you had a deferral and a distribution 
in the same calendar year. If you made a deferral and received a distribution in the 
same calendar year, and you are or will be age 62 by the end of the calendar year, 
your employer should file Form SSA-131, Employer Report of Special Wage 
Payments, with the Social Security Administration and give you a copy.
Box 12. The following list explains the codes shown in box 12. You may need this 
information to complete your tax return. Elective deferrals (codes D, E, F, and S) 
and designated Roth contributions (codes AA, BB, and EE) under all plans are 
generally limited to a total of $22,500 ($15,500 if you have only SIMPLE plans; 
$25,500 for section 403(b) plans if you qualify for the 15-year rule explained in 
Pub. 571). Deferrals under code G are limited to $22,500. Deferrals under code H 
are limited to $7,000.
However, if you were at least age 50 in 2023, your employer may have allowed 
an additional deferral of up to $7,500 ($3,500 for section 401(k)(11) and 408(p) 
SIMPLE plans). This additional deferral amount is not subject to the overall limit on 
elective deferrals. For code G, the limit on elective deferrals may be higher for the 
last 3 years before you reach retirement age. Contact your plan administrator for 
more information. Amounts in excess of the overall elective deferral limit must be 
included in income. See the “Wages, Salaries, Tips, etc.” line instructions for your 
tax return.
