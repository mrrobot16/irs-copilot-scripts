in accordance with the Accuracy of Deposits Rule. See

Form 944 (2022)
Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice. 
We ask for the information on this form to carry out the 
Internal Revenue laws of the United States. We need it to 
figure and collect the right amount of tax. Subtitle C, 
Employment Taxes, of the Internal Revenue Code 
imposes employment taxes on wages and provides for 
income tax withholding. This form is used to determine 
the amount of the taxes that you owe. Section 6011 
requires you to provide the requested information if the 
tax is applicable to you. Section 6109 requires you to 
provide your identification number. If you fail to provide 
this information in a timely manner, or provide false or 
fraudulent information, you may be subject to penalties.
You’re not required to provide the information 
requested on a form that is subject to the Paperwork 
Reduction Act unless the form displays a valid OMB 
control number. Books and records relating to a form or 
instructions must be retained as long as their contents 
may become material in the administration of any Internal 
Revenue law.
Generally, tax returns and return information are 
confidential, as required by section 6103. However, 
section 6103 allows or requires the IRS to disclose or give 
the information shown on your tax return to others as 
described in the Code. For example, we may disclose 
your tax information to the Department of Justice for civil
and criminal litigation, and to cities, states, the District of 
Columbia, and U.S. commonwealths and possessions for 
use in administering their tax laws. We may also disclose 
this information to other countries under a tax treaty, to 
federal and state agencies to enforce federal nontax 
criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and 
intelligence agencies to combat terrorism.
