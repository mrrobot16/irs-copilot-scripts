With respect to each section 721(c) property for which a waiver of treaty benefits was filed, after exercising reasonable diligence, has the U.S. transferor 
determined that to the best of its knowledge and belief, all income from section 721(c) property allocated to the partners during the tax year remained 
subject to taxation as income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (under either section 871 or 882) for 
all direct or indirect partners that are related foreign persons with respect to the U.S. transferor (regardless of whether any such partner was a partner at 
the time of the gain deferral contribution), and that neither the section 721(c) partnership nor any such partner has made any claim under an income tax 
convention to an exemption from U.S. income tax or a reduced rate of U.S. income taxation on income derived from the use of section 721(c) property?
