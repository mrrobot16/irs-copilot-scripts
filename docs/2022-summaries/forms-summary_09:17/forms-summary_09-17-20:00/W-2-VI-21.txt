Copy B—To Be Filed With Employee’s VI Tax Return
Department of the Treasury—Internal Revenue Service 
This information is being furnished to the 
V.I. Bureau of Internal Revenue. 
Notice to Employee
Do you have to file? Refer to the Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR to 
determine if you are required to file a tax return. Even if you don’t have to file a tax 
return, you may be eligible for a refund if box 2 shows an amount or if you are 
eligible for any credit.
Copies B and C; corrections. File Copy B of this form with your 2021 U.S. Virgin 
Islands income tax return. Keep Copy C for your records. If your name, social 
security number (SSN), or address is incorrect, correct Copies B and C and ask 
your employer to correct your employment record. Be sure to ask your employer 
to file Form W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, with the Social Security 
Administration (SSA) to correct any name, amount, or SSN error reported to the 
SSA. 
Estimated tax. If you expect to owe $1,000 or more in tax (including self-
employment tax) for 2022, you may have to make estimated tax payments to the 
U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Use Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals. 
Employee’s social security number (SSN). For your protection, this form may 
show only the last four digits of your SSN. However, your employer has reported 
your complete SSN to the V.I. Bureau of Internal Revenue and the SSA.
Clergy and religious workers. If you aren’t subject to social security and 
Medicare taxes, see Pub. 517, Social Security and Other Information for Members 
of the Clergy and Religious Workers. 
Cost of employer-sponsored health coverage (if such cost is provided by the 
employer). The reporting in box 12, using code DD, of the cost of employer-
sponsored health coverage is for your information only. The amount reported 
with code DD is not taxable.
Credit for excess social security tax. If one employer paid you wages during 
2021 and more than $8,853.60 in social security tax was withheld, you can claim a 
refund of the excess by filing Form 1040 or 1040-SR with the V.I. Bureau of 
Internal Revenue, 6115 Estate Smith Bay, Suite 225, St. Thomas, VI 00802.  
If you had more than one employer in 2021 and more than $8,853.60 in social 
security tax was withheld, you can have the excess refunded by filing Form 843, 
Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement, with the Department of the 
Treasury, Internal Revenue Service Center, Austin, TX 73301-0215, USA. However, 
if you are required to file Form 1040 or 1040-SR with the United States, you must 
claim the excess tax as a credit on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. 
Unreported tip income. You must file Form 4137, Social Security and Medicare 
Tax on Unreported Tip Income, with your income tax return to report at least the
allocated tip amount unless you can prove with adequate records that you 
received a smaller amount. If you have records that show the actual amount of tips 
you received, report that amount even if it is more or less than the allocated tips. 
Use Form 4137 to figure the social security and Medicare tax owed on tips you 
didn’t report to your employer. Enter this amount on the wages line of your tax 
return. (Form 1040-SS filers, see the instructions for Form 1040-SS, Part I, line 6.) 
By filing this form, your social security tips will be credited to your social security 
record (used to figure your benefits).  
(See also the Instructions for Employee on this page and the back of Copy C.)
Instructions for Employee
(See also Notice to Employee on this page.)
Box 5. You may be required to report this amount on Form 8959, Additional 
Medicare Tax. See the Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR to determine if 
you are required to complete Form 8959.
Box 6. This amount includes the 1.45% Medicare Tax withheld on all Medicare 
wages and tips shown in box 5, as well as the 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax on 
any of those Medicare wages and tips above $200,000. 
Box 11. This amount is (a) reported in box 1 if it is a distribution made to you from 
a nonqualified deferred compensation or nongovernmental section 457(b) plan, or 
(b) included in box 3 and/or box 5 if it is a prior year deferral under a nonqualified 
or section 457(b) plan that became taxable for social security and Medicare taxes 
this year because there is no longer a substantial risk of forfeiture of your right to 
the deferred amount. This box shouldn’t be used if you had a deferral and a 
distribution in the same calendar year. If you made a deferral and received a 
distribution in the same calendar year, and you are or will be age 62 by the end of 
the calendar year, your employer should file Form SSA-131, Employer Report of 
Special Wage Payments, with the Social Security Administration and give you a 
copy.
Box 12. The following list explains the codes shown in box 12. You may need this 
information to complete your tax return. Elective deferrals (codes D, E, F, and S) 
and designated Roth contributions (codes AA, BB, and EE) under all plans are 
generally limited to a total of $19,500 ($13,500 if you have only SIMPLE plans; 
$22,500 for section 403(b) plans if you qualify for the 15-year rule explained in 
Pub. 571). Deferrals under code G are limited to $19,500. Deferrals under code H 
are limited to $7,000.

Box 12 (continued)
However, if you were at least age 50 in 2021, your employer may have allowed an 
additional deferral of up to $6,500 ($3,000 for section 401(k)(11) and 408(p) SIMPLE 
plans). This additional deferral amount is not subject to the overall limit on elective 
deferrals. For code G, the limit on elective deferrals may be higher for the last 3 
years before you reach retirement age. Contact your plan administrator for more 
information. Amounts in excess of the overall elective deferral limit must be included 
in income. See the “Wages, Salaries, Tips, etc.” line instructions for your tax return. 
Note: If a year follows code D through H, S, Y, AA, BB, or EE, you made a make-up 
pension contribution for a prior year(s) when you were in military service. To figure
