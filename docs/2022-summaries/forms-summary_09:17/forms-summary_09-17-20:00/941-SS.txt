Form 941-SS (Rev. 3-2023)
Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice. 
We ask for the information on Form 941-SS to carry out 
the Internal Revenue laws of the United States. We 
need it to figure and collect the right amount of tax. 
Subtitle C, Employment Taxes, of the Internal Revenue 
Code imposes employment taxes on wages and provides 
for income tax withholding. Form 941-SS is used to 
determine the amount of the taxes that you owe. Section 
6011 requires you to provide the requested information if 
the tax is applicable to you. Section 6109 requires you to 
provide your identification number. If you fail to provide 
this information in a timely manner or provide false or 
fraudulent information, you may be subject to penalties.
You’re not required to provide the information 
requested on a form that is subject to the Paperwork 
Reduction Act unless the form displays a valid OMB 
control number. Books and records relating to a form or 
its instructions must be retained as long as their 
contents may become material in the administration of 
any Internal Revenue law.
Generally, tax returns and return information are 
confidential, as required by section 6103. However, 
section 6103 allows or requires the IRS to disclose or  
give the information shown on your tax return to others  
as described in the Code. For example, we may  
disclose your tax information to the Department of
Justice for civil and criminal litigation, and to cities, 
states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. commonwealths 
and possessions for use in administering their tax laws. 
We may also disclose this information to other countries 
under a tax treaty, to federal and state agencies to 
enforce federal nontax criminal laws, or to federal law 
enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat 
terrorism.
The time needed to complete and file Form 941-SS 
will vary depending on individual circumstances. The
