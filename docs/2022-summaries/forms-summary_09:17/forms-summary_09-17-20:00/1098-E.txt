This is important tax 
information and is being 
furnished to the IRS. If 
you are required to file a 
return, a negligence 
penalty or other 
sanction may be 
imposed on you if the 
IRS determines that an 
underpayment of tax 
results because you 
overstated a deduction 
for student loan interest.

Instructions for Borrower
A person (including a financial institution, a governmental unit, 
and an educational institution) that receives interest payments 
of $600 or more during the year on one or more qualified 
student loans must furnish this statement to you.
You may be able to deduct student loan interest that you 
actually paid in 2023 on your income tax return. However, you 
may not be able to deduct the full amount of interest reported 
on this statement. Do not contact the recipient/lender for 
explanations of the requirements for (and how to figure) any 
allowable deduction for the interest paid. Instead, for more 
information, see Pub. 970, and the Student Loan Interest 
Deduction Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1040.
Borrower’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your 
protection, this form may show only the last four digits of your 
TIN (social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer 
identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification 
number (ATIN), or employer identification number (EIN)). 
However, the issuer has reported your complete TIN to the 
IRS.
Account number. May show an account or other unique 
number the lender assigned to distinguish your account.
Box 1. Shows the interest received by the lender during the 
year on one or more student loans made to you. For loans 
made on or after September 1, 2004, box 1 must include loan 
origination fees and capitalized interest received in 2023. If 
your loan was made before September 1, 2004, you may be 
able to deduct loan origination fees and capitalized interest 
not reported in box 1.
Box 2. If checked, indicates that loan origination fees and/or 
capitalized interest are not included in box 1 for loans made 
before September 1, 2004. See Pub. 970 for how to figure any 
deductible loan origination fees or capitalized interest.
