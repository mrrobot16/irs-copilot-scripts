You must complete this form if you’re a semiweekly schedule depositor or became one because your accumulated tax liability during any month was 
$100,000 or more. Show tax liability here, not deposits. (The IRS gets deposit data from electronic funds transfers.) Don’t change your current year tax 
liability by adjustments reported on any Form 945-X, CT-1 X, or 944-X.
