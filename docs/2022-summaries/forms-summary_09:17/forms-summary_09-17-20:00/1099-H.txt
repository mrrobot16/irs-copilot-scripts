Instructions for Recipient
This statement is provided to you because you received 
Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) advance payments 
of your health coverage insurance premiums. These 
advance payments were forwarded directly to your 
health insurance provider. You are qualified to receive 
advance payments if you were an eligible trade 
adjustment assistance (TAA) recipient, an Alternative 
TAA (ATAA) recipient, a Reemployment TAA (RTAA) 
recipient, or a Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation 
(PBGC) pension payee. See Form 8885, Health 
Coverage Tax Credit, and its instructions for more 
details on qualified recipients and how to figure any 
credit that you may be able to take on your Form 1040, 
1040-SR, 1040-NR, 1040-SS, or 1040-PR.
Recipient’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For 
your protection, this form may show only the last four 
digits of your TIN (social security number (SSN), 
individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), or 
adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN)).
However, the issuer has reported your complete TIN to 
the IRS.
Box 1. Shows the total amount of HCTC advance 
payments of qualified health insurance costs that were 
made on your behalf. 
Box 2. Shows the total number of months you received 
HCTC payments.
Boxes 3 through 14. Shows the amount of HCTC 
advance payments paid for you for each month. The 
total of the amounts shown in these boxes equals the 
amount shown in box 1.
