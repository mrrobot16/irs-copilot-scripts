Form 940 (2022) 
Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice.   
We ask for the information on this form to carry out the  
Internal Revenue laws of the United States. We need it  
to figure and collect the right amount of tax. Chapter  
23, Federal Unemployment Tax Act, of Subtitle C,  
Employment Taxes, of the Internal Revenue Code  
imposes a tax on employers with respect to employees. 
This form is used to determine the amount of the tax that 
you owe. Section 6011 requires you to provide the 
requested information if you are liable for FUTA tax under 
section 3301. Section 6109 requires you to provide your 
identification number. If you fail to provide this 
information in a timely manner or provide a false or 
fraudulent form, you may be subject to penalties.
You’re not required to provide the information  
requested on a form that is subject to the Paperwork  
Reduction Act unless the form displays a valid OMB  
control number. Books and records relating to a form or 
instructions must be retained as long as their contents 
may become material in the administration of any Internal 
Revenue law. 
Generally, tax returns and return information are  
confidential, as required by section 6103. However,  
section 6103 allows or requires the IRS to disclose or  
give the information shown on your tax return to others  
as described in the Code. For example, we may disclose
your tax information to the Department of Justice for civil 
and criminal litigation, and to cities, states, the District of 
Columbia, and U.S. commonwealths and possessions to 
administer their tax laws. We may also disclose this 
information to other countries under a tax treaty, to 
federal and state agencies to enforce federal nontax 
criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and 
intelligence agencies to combat terrorism. 
The time needed to complete and file this form will vary 
depending on individual circumstances. The estimated
