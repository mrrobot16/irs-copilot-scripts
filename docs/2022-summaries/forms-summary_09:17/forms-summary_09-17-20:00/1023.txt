Part X 
Public Charity Status 
Part X is designed to classify you as an organization that is either a private foundation or a public charity. Public charity status is a 
more favorable tax status than private foundation status. If you are a private foundation, Part X is designed to further determine 
whether you are a private operating foundation. See instructions. 
1 a
Are you a private foundation? If “Yes,” go to line 1b. If “No,” go to line 5 and proceed as instructed. If you
are unsure, see the instructions. 
Yes
No
b As a private foundation, section 508(e) requires special provisions in your organizing document in 
addition to those that apply to all organizations described in section 501(c)(3). Check the box to confirm
that your organizing document meets this requirement, whether by express provision or by reliance on
operation of state law. Attach a statement that describes specifically where your organizing document 
meets this requirement, such as a reference to a particular article or section in your organizing document 
or by operation of state law. See the instructions, including Appendix B, for information about the special
provisions that need to be contained in your organizing document. Go to line 2. 
2 
Are you a private operating foundation? To be a private operating foundation you must engage directly in
the active conduct of charitable, religious, educational, and similar activities, as opposed to indirectly 
carrying out these activities by providing grants to individuals or other organizations. If “Yes,” go to line 3. 
If “No,” go to the signature section of Part XI. 
Yes
No
3 
Have you existed for one or more years? If “Yes,” attach financial information showing that you are a 
private  operating foundation; go to the signature section of Part XI. If “No,” continue to line 4. 
Yes
No
4 
Have you attached either (1) an affidavit or opinion of counsel, (including a written affidavit or opinion 
from a certified public accountant or accounting firm with expertise regarding this tax law matter), that 
sets forth facts concerning your operations and support to demonstrate that you are likely to satisfy the
requirements to be classified as a private operating foundation; or (2) a statement describing your 
proposed operations as a private operating foundation? 
Yes
No
5 
If you answered “No” to line 1a, indicate the type of public charity status you are requesting by checking one of the choices 
below.  You may check only one box. 
The organization is not a private foundation because it is: 
a 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(i)—a church or a convention or association of churches. Complete and attach Schedule A. 
b 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(ii)—a school. Complete and attach Schedule B. 
c 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(iii)—a hospital, a cooperative hospital service organization, or a medical research 
organization operated in conjunction with a hospital. Complete and attach Schedule C. 
d 509(a)(3)—an organization supporting either one or more organizations described in line 5a through c, f, h, or i or a 
publicly supported section 501(c)(4), (5), or (6) organization. Complete and attach Schedule D.
