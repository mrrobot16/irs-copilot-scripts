1   For example, a sole proprietorship or self-employed farmer who establishes a qualified retirement plan, or is required to file excise, employment, alcohol, tobacco, or 
firearms returns, must have an EIN. A partnership, corporation, REMIC (real estate mortgage investment conduit), nonprofit organization (church, club, etc.), or farmers’ 
cooperative must use an EIN for any tax-related purpose even if the entity doesn’t have employees. 
2  However, don’t apply for a new EIN if the existing entity only (a) changed its business name, (b) elected on Form 8832 to change the way it is taxed (or is covered by the 
default rules), or (c) terminated its partnership status because at least 50% of the total interests in partnership capital and profits were sold or exchanged within a 12-
month period. The EIN of the terminated partnership should continue to be used. See Regulations section 301.6109-1(d)(2)(iii). 
3  Don’t use the EIN of the prior business unless you became the “owner” of a corporation by acquiring its stock.

must have an EIN. For more information on grantor trusts, see the Instructions for Form 1041. 
5  A plan administrator is the person or group of persons specified as the administrator by the instrument under which the plan is operated.

7  See also Household employer agent in the instructions. Note: State or local agencies may need an EIN for other reasons, for example, hired employees. 
8  See Disregarded entities in the instructions for details on completing Form SS-4 for an LLC. 
9  An existing corporation that is electing or revoking S corporation status should use its previously-assigned EIN.
