Form 1099-Q (Rev. 11-2019)
(keep for your records)
www.irs.gov/Form1099Q
Instructions for Recipient
Distributions from Coverdell education savings accounts (CESAs) under section 530 
and qualified tuition programs (QTPs) under section 529, including rollovers, may be 
taxable. Nontaxable distributions from CESAs and QTPs are not required to be 
reported on your income tax return. You must determine the taxability of any 
distribution. See Pub. 970 and the Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR for more 
information. Also see Form 5329 and its separate instructions.
Recipient’s taxpayer identification no. (TIN). For your protection, this form may 
show only the last four digits of your TIN (SSN, ITIN, ATIN, or EIN). However, the payer 
or trustee has reported your complete TIN to the IRS.
Account number. May show an account or other unique number the payer has 
assigned to distinguish your account.
Box 1. Shows the gross distribution (including in-kind distributions) paid to you this 
year from a QTP or a CESA. This amount is the total of the amounts shown in boxes 2 
and 3. See Pub. 970 for more information.
Caution: For CESA distributions (other than earnings on excess contributions) made during the 
calendar year, the payer/trustee is not required to report amounts in boxes 2 and 3. Instead, the 
payer/trustee may report the fair market value of the CESA as of December 31 of the calendar 
year in the blank box below boxes 5 and 6. To figure your earnings and basis, use the Coverdell 
ESA—Taxable Distributions and Basis worksheet in Pub. 970.
Box 2. Shows the earnings part of the gross distribution shown in box 1. Generally, 
amounts distributed that are used to pay for qualified education expenses, transferred 
between trustees, or rolled over to another qualified education program or to an ABLE 
account, within 60 days, are not included in income. 
 Under a QTP, the amount in box 2 is included in income if there has been (a) more 
than one transfer or rollover within any 12-month period with respect to the same 
beneficiary, or (b) a change in the designated beneficiary and the new designated 
beneficiary is not a family member. 
Under a CESA, the amount in box 2 is included in income if there has been a 
change in the designated beneficiary and the new designated beneficiary is not a 
family member or is over age 30 (except for beneficiaries with special needs).
Also, an additional 10% tax may apply to part or all of any amount included in 
income from the CESA or QTP. See Form 5329 and your tax return instructions for 
more information.
If a final (total) distribution is made from your account and you have not recovered 
your contributions, see Pub. 970 to determine if you have a deductible loss and how to 
claim it.
Box 3. Shows your basis in the gross distribution reported in box 1.
Box 4. This box is checked if a trustee-to-trustee transfer was made from one QTP to 
another QTP, from one CESA to another CESA, from a CESA to a QTP, or from a QTP to an 
ABLE account. However, in certain transfers from a CESA, the box will be blank.
Box 5. Shows whether the gross distribution was from a QTP (private or state) or from 
a CESA.
Box 6. The designated beneficiary is the individual named in the document creating 
the trust or custodial account to receive the benefit of the funds in the account. If you 
are not the designated beneficiary, see Pub. 970 and the Instructions for Forms 1040 
and 1040-SR.
Distribution codes. For the calendar year, the payer/trustee may, but is not required 
to, report (in the box below boxes 5 and 6) one of the following codes to identify the 
distribution you received: 1—Distributions (including transfers); 2—Excess 
contributions plus earnings taxable in the calendar year; 3—Excess contributions plus 
earnings taxable in the prior calendar year; 4—Disability; 5—Death; or 6—Prohibited 
transaction.
