Part III 
Method of Cost Allocation (Complete this part if the requested change involves either property subject  to 
section 263A or long-term contracts as described in section 460.) See instructions. 
Section A—Allocation and Capitalization Methods 
Attach a description (including sample computations) of the present and proposed method(s) the applicant uses to capitalize direct 
and indirect costs properly allocable to real or tangible personal property produced and property acquired for resale, or to allocate 
direct and indirect costs required to be allocated to long-term contracts. Include a description of the  method(s) used for allocating 
indirect costs to intermediate cost objectives such as departments or activities prior to the allocation of such costs to long-term 
contracts, real or tangible personal property produced, and property acquired for resale. The description  must include the following: 
1 
The method of allocating direct and indirect costs (for example, specific identification, burden rate, standard cost, or other 
reasonable allocation method). 
2 
The method of allocating mixed service costs (for example, direct reallocation, step-allocation, simplified service cost using the 
labor-based allocation ratio, simplified service cost using the production cost allocation ratio, or other reasonable allocation 
method). 
3 
Except for long-term contract accounting methods, the method of capitalizing additional section 263A costs (for example, 
simplified production with or without the historic absorption  ratio election, modified simplified production with or without the
historic absorption ratio election, simplified resale with or without the historic absorption ratio election including permissible 
variations, the U.S. ratio, or other reasonable allocation method). 
Section B—Direct and Indirect Costs Required To Be Allocated
Check the appropriate boxes showing the costs that are or will be fully included, to the extent required, in the cost of real or tangible 
personal property produced or property acquired for resale under section 263A or allocated to long-term contracts under section 460. 
Mark “N/A” in a box if those costs are not incurred by the applicant. If a box is not checked, it is assumed that those costs are not 
fully included to the extent required. Attach an explanation for boxes that are not checked.
