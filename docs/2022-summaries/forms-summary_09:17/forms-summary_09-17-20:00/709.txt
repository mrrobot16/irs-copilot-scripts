Terminable Interest (QTIP) Marital Deduction. (See instructions for Schedule A, Part 4, line 4.) 
If a trust (or other property) meets the requirements of qualified terminable interest property under section 2523(f), and: 
a. The trust (or other property) is listed on Schedule A; and 
b. The value of the trust (or other property) is entered in whole or in part as a deduction on Schedule A, Part 4, line 4, then the donor shall be 
deemed to have made an election to have such trust (or other property) treated as qualified terminable interest property under section 2523(f). 
If less than the entire value of the trust (or other property) that the donor has included in Parts 1 and 3 of Schedule A is entered as a deduction 
on line 4, the donor shall be considered to have made an election only as to a fraction of the trust (or other property). The numerator of this 
fraction is equal to the amount of the trust (or other property) deducted on Schedule A, Part 4, line 6. The denominator is equal to the total 
value of the trust (or other property) listed in Parts 1 and 3 of Schedule A. 
If you make the QTIP election, the terminable interest property involved will be included in your spouse’s gross estate upon his or her death 
(section 2044). See instructions for line 4 of Schedule A. If your spouse disposes (by gift or otherwise) of all or part of the qualifying life income 
interest, he or she will be considered to have made a transfer of the entire property that is subject to the gift tax. See Transfer of Certain Life 
Estates Received From Spouse in the instructions. 
12 
Election Out of QTIP Treatment of Annuities 
Check here if you elect under section 2523(f)(6) not to treat as qualified terminable interest property any joint and survivor annuities that are 
reported on Schedule A and would otherwise be treated as qualified terminable interest property under section 2523(f). See instructions. Enter the 
item numbers from Schedule A for the annuities for which you are making this election:
