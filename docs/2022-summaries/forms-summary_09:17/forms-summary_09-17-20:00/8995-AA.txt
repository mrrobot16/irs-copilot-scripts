Your taxpayer identification number
Complete Schedule A only if your trade or business is a specified service trade or business (see instructions) and your taxable income is more 
than $170,050 but not $220,050 ($340,100 and $440,100 if married filing jointly). If your taxable income isn’t more than $170,050 ($340,100 if 
married filing jointly) and you’re not a patron of an agricultural or horticultural cooperative, don’t file this form; instead, file Form 8995, Qualified 
Business Income Deduction Simplified Computation. Otherwise, complete Schedule D (Form 8995-A) before beginning Schedule A. If your 
taxable income is more than $220,050 ($440,100 if married filing jointly), your specified service trade or business doesn’t qualify for the 
deduction. If you have more than three trades or businesses, attach as many Schedules A as needed. See instructions.
