Form 1099-R
www.irs.gov/Form1099R
Instructions for Recipient
Generally, distributions from retirement plans (IRAs, qualified plans,
section 403(b) plans, and governmental section 457(b) plans), 
insurance contracts, etc., are reported to recipients on Form 1099-R.
Qualified plans and section 403(b) plans. If your annuity starting 
date is after 1997, you must use the simplified method to figure your 
taxable amount if your payer didn’t show the taxable amount in box 
2a. See the instructions for your tax return.
IRAs. For distributions from a traditional individual retirement 
arrangement (IRA), simplified employee pension (SEP), or savings 
incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLE), generally the payer isn’t 
required to compute the taxable amount. See the instructions for your 
tax return to determine the taxable amount. If you’re at least age 72, 
you must take minimum distributions from your IRA (other than a Roth 
IRA). If you don’t, you’re subject to a 50% excise tax on the amount 
that should’ve been distributed. See Pub. 590-A and Pub. 590-B for 
more information on IRAs.
Roth IRAs. For distributions from a Roth IRA, generally the payer isn’t 
required to compute the taxable amount. You must compute any 
taxable amount on Form 8606. An amount shown in box 2a may be 
taxable earnings on an excess contribution.
Loans treated as distributions. If you borrow money from a qualified 
plan, section 403(b) plan, or governmental section 457(b) plan, you 
may have to treat the loan as a distribution and include all or part of 
the amount borrowed in your income. There are exceptions to this 
rule. If your loan is taxable, code L will be shown in box 7. See Pub. 
575.
Recipient’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your 
protection, this form may show only the last four digits of your TIN 
(SSN, ITIN, ATIN, or EIN). However, the payer has reported your 
complete TIN to the IRS.
Account number. May show an account, policy, or other unique 
number the payer assigned to distinguish your account.
Box 1. Shows the total amount distributed this year. The amount may 
have been a direct rollover, a transfer or conversion to a Roth IRA, a 
recharacterized IRA contribution; or you may have received it
as periodic payments, nonperiodic payments, or a total distribution. 
Report the amount on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR on the line 
for “IRA distributions” or “Pensions and annuities” (or the line for 
“Taxable amount”) and on Form 8606, as applicable. However, if this 
is a lump-sum distribution, see Form 4972. If you haven’t reached 
minimum retirement age, report your disability payments on the line 
for “Wages, salaries, tips, etc.” on your tax return. Also report on that 
line permissible withdrawals from eligible automatic contribution 
arrangements and corrective distributions of excess deferrals, excess 
contributions, or excess aggregate contributions except if the 
distribution is of designated Roth contributions or your after-tax 
contributions or if you’re self-employed.
If a life insurance, annuity, qualified long-term care, or endowment 
contract was transferred tax free to another trustee or contract issuer, 
an amount will be shown in this box and code 6 will be shown in box 
7. If a charge or payment was made against the cash value of an 
annuity contract or the cash surrender value of a life insurance 
contract for the purchase of qualified long-term care insurance, an 
amount will be shown in this box and code W will be shown in box 7. 
You need not report these amounts on your tax return. If code C is 
shown in box 7, the amount shown in box 1 is a receipt of reportable 
death benefits that is taxable in part.
Box 2a. This part of the distribution is generally taxable. If there is no 
entry in this box, the payer may not have all the facts needed to figure 
the taxable amount. In that case, the first box in box 2b should be 
checked. You may want to get one of the free publications from the 
IRS to help you figure the taxable amount. See Additional information 
on the back of Copy 2. For an IRA distribution, see IRAs and Roth 
IRAs, earlier. For a direct rollover, other than from a qualified plan, 
section 403(b) plan, or governmental section 457(b) plan to a 
designated Roth account in the same plan or to a Roth IRA, zero 
should be shown and you must enter zero (-0-) on the “Taxable 
amount” line of your tax return. If you roll over a distribution (other 
than a distribution from a designated Roth account) from a qualified 
plan, section 403(b) plan, or governmental section 457(b) plan to a 
designated Roth account in the same plan or to a Roth IRA, you must

Instructions for Recipient  (continued)
include on the “Taxable amount” line of your tax return the amount 
shown in this box plus the amount in box 6, if any. 
If this is a total distribution from a qualified plan and you were born 
before January 2, 1936 (or you’re the beneficiary of someone born 
before January 2, 1936), you may be eligible for the 10-year tax 
option. See the Form 4972 instructions for more information.
If you’re an eligible retired public safety officer who elected to 
exclude from income distributions from your eligible plan used to pay 
certain insurance premiums, the amount shown in box 2a hasn’t been 
reduced by the exclusion amount. See the instructions for your tax 
return for more information.
Box 2b. If the first box is checked, the payer was unable to determine 
the taxable amount and box 2a should be blank, except for an IRA. 
It’s your responsibility to determine the taxable amount. If the second 
box is checked, the distribution was a total distribution that closed out 
your account. 
Box 3. If you received a lump-sum distribution from a qualified plan 
and were born before January 2, 1936 (or you’re the beneficiary of 
someone born before January 2, 1936), you may be able to elect to 
treat this amount as a capital gain on Form 4972 (not on Schedule D 
(Form 1040)). See the Form 4972 instructions. For a charitable gift 
annuity, report as a long-term capital gain as explained in the 
Instructions for Form 8949.
Box 4. Shows federal income tax withheld. Include this amount on 
your income tax return as tax withheld, and if box 4 shows an amount 
(other than zero), attach Copy B to your return. Generally, if you 
receive payments that aren’t eligible rollover distributions, you can 
change your withholding or elect not to have income tax withheld by 
giving the payer Form W-4P.
Box 5. Generally, this shows the employee’s investment in the 
contract (after-tax contributions), if any, recovered tax free this year; 
the portion that’s your basis in a designated Roth account; the part of 
premiums paid on commercial annuities or insurance contracts 
recovered tax free; the nontaxable part of a charitable gift annuity; or 
the investment in a life insurance contract reportable under section 
6050Y. This box doesn’t show any IRA contributions. If the amount 
shown is your basis in a designated Roth account, the year you first 
made contributions to that account may be entered in box 11.  
Box 6. If you received a lump-sum distribution from a qualified plan 
that includes securities of the employer’s company, the net unrealized 
appreciation (NUA) (any increase in value of such securities while in 
the trust) is taxed only when you sell the securities unless you choose 
to include it in your gross income this year. See Pub. 575 and       
Form 4972. If you roll over the distribution to a designated Roth 
account in the same plan or to a Roth IRA, see the instructions for box 
2a. For a direct rollover to a designated Roth account in the same plan 
or to a Roth IRA, the NUA is included in box 2a. If you didn’t receive a 
lump-sum distribution, the amount shown is the NUA attributable to 
employee contributions, which isn’t taxed until you sell the securities.
Box 7. The following codes identify the distribution you received. For 
more information on these distributions, see the instructions for your 
tax return. Also, certain distributions may be subject to an additional 
10% tax. See the Instructions for Form 5329.
1—Early distribution, no known exception (in most cases, under age 
59½).
2—Early distribution, exception applies (under age 59½).
3—Disability.
4—Death.
5—Prohibited transaction.
6—Section 1035 exchange (a tax-free exchange of life insurance, 
annuity, qualified long-term care insurance, or endowment

8—Excess contributions plus earnings/excess deferrals (and/or 
earnings) taxable in 2023.
9—Cost of current life insurance protection.
A—May be eligible for 10-year tax option (see Form 4972).
B—Designated Roth account distribution.
Note: If code B is in box 7 and an amount is reported in box 11,  
see the Instructions for Form 5329.
C—Reportable death benefits under section 6050Y.
D—Annuity payments from nonqualified annuities that may be subject 
to tax under section 1411.
E—Distributions under Employee Plans Compliance Resolution 
System (EPCRS).

IRA, SEP, or SIMPLE distribution.
Box 8. If you received an annuity contract as part of a distribution, the 
value of the contract is shown. It isn’t taxable when you receive it and 
shouldn’t be included in boxes 1 and 2a. When you receive periodic 
payments from the annuity contract, they’re taxable at that time. If the 
distribution is made to more than one person, the percentage of the 
annuity contract distributed to you is also shown. You’ll need this 
information if you use the 10-year tax option (Form 4972). If charges
were made for qualified long-term care insurance contracts under 
combined arrangements, the amount of the reduction in the 
investment (but not below zero) in the annuity or life insurance 
contract is reported here. 
Box 9a. If a total distribution was made to more than one person, the 
percentage you received is shown.
Box 9b. For a life annuity from a qualified plan or from a section 
403(b) plan (with after-tax contributions), an amount may be shown for 
the employee’s total investment in the contract. It is used to compute 
the taxable part of the distribution. See Pub. 575.
Box 10. If an amount is reported in this box, see the Instructions for 
Form 5329 and Pub. 575.
Box 11. The first year you made a contribution to the designated Roth

Box 12. If checked, the payer is reporting on this Form 1099 to satisfy 
its Internal Revenue Code chapter 4 account reporting requirement 
under FATCA. You may also have a filing requirement. See the 
Instructions for Form 8938.
Box 13. Shows the date of payment for reportable death benefits 
under section 6050Y.
Boxes 14–19. If state or local income tax was withheld from the 
distribution, boxes 16 and 19 may show the part of the distribution 
subject to state and/or local tax.
