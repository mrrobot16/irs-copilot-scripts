Instructions for Employee
You have received this form because your employer (or transfer 
agent) transferred your employer’s stock to you pursuant to your 
exercise of an incentive stock option (ISO). You must recognize 
(report) gain or loss on your tax return for the year in which you 
sell or otherwise dispose of the stock. Keep this form and use it to 
figure the gain or loss. For more information, see Pub. 525, 
Taxable and Nontaxable Income.
When you exercise an ISO, you may have to include in 
alternative minimum taxable income a portion of the fair market 
value of the stock acquired through the exercise of the option. For 
more information, see Form 6251, Alternative Minimum             
Tax—Individuals, and its instructions.
Employee’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your 
protection, this form may show only the last four digits of your 
social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification 
number (ITIN), or adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN). 
However, the employer has reported your complete TIN to the 
IRS.
Account number. May show an account or other unique number 
your employer or transfer agent assigned to distinguish your 
account.
Box 1. Shows the date the option to purchase the stock was 
granted to you.
Box 2. Shows the date you exercised the option to purchase the 
stock.
Box 3. Shows the exercise price per share of stock.
Box 4. Shows the fair market value (FMV) of a share of stock on 
the date the option was exercised.
Box 5. Shows the number of shares of stock transferred to you 
pursuant to the exercise of the option.
Box 6. Shows the name, address, and TIN of the corporation 
whose stock is being transferred (if other than the corporation 
shown in TRANSFEROR boxes in the upper left corner of the 
form).
