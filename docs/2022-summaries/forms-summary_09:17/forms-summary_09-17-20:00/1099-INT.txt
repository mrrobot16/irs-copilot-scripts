(keep for your records)
www.irs.gov/Form1099INT
Instructions for Recipient
The information provided may be different for covered and noncovered 
securities. For a description of covered securities, see the Instructions for 
Form 8949. For a taxable covered security acquired at a premium, unless you 
notified the payer in writing in accordance with Regulations section 
1.6045-1(n)(5) that you did not want to amortize the premium under section 171, 
or for a tax-exempt covered security acquired at a premium, your payer must 
generally report either (1) a net amount of interest that reflects the offset of the 
amount of interest paid to you by the amount of premium amortization allocable 
to the payment(s), or (2) a gross amount for both the interest paid to you and the 
premium amortization allocable to the payment(s). If you did notify your payer 
that you did not want to amortize the premium on a taxable covered security, 
then your payer will only report the gross amount of interest paid to you. For a 
noncovered security acquired at a premium, your payer is only required to report 
the gross amount of interest paid to you.
Recipient’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your protection, this 
form may show only the last four digits of your TIN (social security number 
(SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer 
identification number (ATIN), or employer identification number (EIN)). However, 
the issuer has reported your complete TIN to the IRS.
FATCA filing requirement. If the FATCA filing requirement box is checked, the 
payer is reporting on this Form 1099 to satisfy its chapter 4 account reporting 
requirement. You may also have a filing requirement. See the Instructions for 
Form 8938.
Account number. May show an account or other unique number the payer 
assigned to distinguish your account.
Box 1. Shows taxable interest paid to you during the calendar year by the payer. 
This does not include interest shown in box 3. May also show the total amount 
of the credits from clean renewable energy bonds, new clean renewable energy 
bonds, qualified energy conservation bonds, qualified zone academy bonds, 
qualified school construction bonds, and build America bonds that must be 
included in your interest income. These amounts were treated as paid to you 
during the calendar year on the credit allowance dates (March 15, June 15, 
September 15, and December 15). For more information, see Form 8912. See 
the instructions above for a taxable covered security acquired at a premium.
Box 2. Shows interest or principal forfeited because of early withdrawal of time 
savings. You may deduct this amount to figure your adjusted gross income on 
your income tax return. See the Instructions for Form 1040 to see where to take 
the deduction.
Box 3. Shows interest on U.S. Savings Bonds, Treasury bills, Treasury bonds, 
and Treasury notes. This may or may not all be taxable. See Pub. 550. This 
interest is exempt from state and local income taxes. This interest is not 
included in box 1. See the instructions above for a taxable covered security 
acquired at a premium.
Box 4. Shows backup withholding. Generally, a payer must backup withhold if 
you did not furnish your TIN or you did not furnish the correct TIN to the payer. 
See Form W-9. Include this amount on your income tax return as tax withheld. 
Box 5. Any amount shown is your share of investment expenses of a single-
class REMIC. This amount is included in box 1. Note: This amount is not 
deductible.
Box 6. Shows foreign tax paid. You may be able to claim this tax as a deduction 
or a credit on your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. See your tax return instructions.
Box 7. Shows the country or U.S. possession to which the foreign tax was paid.
Box 8. Shows tax-exempt interest paid to you during the calendar year by the 
payer. See how to report this amount in the Instructions for Form 1040. This 
amount may be subject to backup withholding. See Box 4 above. See the 
instructions above for a tax-exempt covered security acquired at a premium.
Box 9. Shows tax-exempt interest subject to the alternative minimum tax. This 
amount is included in box 8. See the Instructions for Form 6251. See the 
instructions above for a tax-exempt covered security acquired at a premium.
Box 10. For a taxable or tax-exempt covered security, if you made an election 
under section 1278(b) to include market discount in income as it accrues and 
you notified your payer of the election in writing in accordance with Regulations 
section 1.6045-1(n)(5), shows the market discount that accrued on the debt 
instrument during the year while held by you, unless it was reported on Form 
1099-OID. For a taxable or tax-exempt covered security acquired on or after 
January 1, 2015, accrued market discount will be calculated on a constant yield 
basis unless you notified your payer in writing in accordance with Regulations 
section 1.6045-1(n)(5) that you did not want to make a constant yield election for 
market discount under section 1276(b). Report the accrued market discount on 
your income tax return as directed in the Instructions for Form 1040. Market 
discount on a tax-exempt security is includible in taxable income as interest 
income.

Instructions for Recipient (continued)
Box 11. For a taxable covered security (other than a U.S. Treasury 
obligation), shows the amount of premium amortization allocable to 
the interest payment(s), unless you notified the payer in writing in 
accordance with Regulations section 1.6045-1(n)(5) that you did not 
want to amortize bond premium under section 171. If an amount is 
reported in this box, see the Instructions for Schedule B (Form 1040) 
to determine the net amount of interest includible in income on Form 
1040 or 1040-SR with respect to the security. If an amount is not 
reported in this box for a taxable covered security acquired at a 
premium and the payer is reporting premium amortization, the payer 
has reported a net amount of interest in box 1. If the amount in box 11 
is greater than the amount of interest paid on the covered security, 
see Regulations section 1.171-2(a)(4).
Box 12. For a U.S. Treasury obligation that is a covered security, 
shows the amount of premium amortization allocable to the interest 
payment(s), unless you notified the payer in writing in accordance with 
Regulations section 1.6045-1(n)(5) that you did not want to amortize 
bond premium under section 171. If an amount is reported in this box, 
see the Instructions for Schedule B (Form 1040) to determine the net 
amount of interest includible in income on Form 1040 or 1040-SR with 
respect to the U.S. Treasury obligation. If an amount is not reported in 
this box for a U.S. Treasury obligation that is a covered security 
acquired at a premium and the payer is reporting premium 
amortization, the payer has reported a net amount of interest in box 3. 
If the amount in box 12 is greater than the amount of interest paid on 
the U.S. Treasury obligation, see Regulations section 1.171-2(a)(4).
Box 13. For a tax-exempt covered security, shows the amount of 
premium amortization allocable to the interest payment(s). If an 
amount is reported in this box, see Pub. 550 to determine the net   
amount of tax-exempt interest reportable on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. 
If an amount is not reported in this box for a tax-exempt covered 
security acquired at a premium, the payer has reported a net amount 
of interest in box 8 or 9, whichever is applicable. If the amount in box 
13 is greater than the amount of interest paid on the tax-exempt 
covered security, the excess is a nondeductible loss. See Regulations 
section 1.171-2(a)(4)(ii).
Box 14. Shows CUSIP number(s) for tax-exempt bond(s) on which 
tax-exempt interest was paid, or tax credit bond(s) on which taxable 
interest was paid or tax credit was allowed, to you during the calendar 
year. If blank, no CUSIP number was issued for the bond(s).
Boxes 15–17. State tax withheld reporting boxes.

person(s), you are considered a nominee recipient. Complete a
