Part IV 
Foundation Classification 
Part IV is designed to classify you as an organization that is either a private foundation or a public charity. Public charity 
status is a more favorable tax status than private foundation status.
1 If you qualify for public charity status, check the appropriate box (1a – 1c below) and skip to Part V below.
a
Check this box to attest that you normally receive at least one-third of your support from public sources or you normally receive at least 10 
percent of your support from public sources and you have other characteristics of a publicly supported organization. Sections 509(a)(1) and 
170(b)(1)(A)(vi).
b
Check this box to attest that you normally receive more than one-third of your support from a combination of gifts, grants, contributions, 
membership fees, and gross receipts (from permitted sources) from activities related to your exempt functions and normally receive not more 
than one-third of your support from investment income and unrelated business taxable income. Section 509(a)(2).
c
Check this box to attest that you are operated for the benefit of a college or university that is owned or operated by a governmental unit. 
Sections 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(iv).
2 If you are not described in items 1a – 1c above, you are a private foundation. As a private foundation, you are required by section 508(e) to have 
specific provisions in your organizing document, unless you rely on the operation of state law in the state in which you were formed to meet 
these requirements. These specific provisions require that you operate to avoid liability for private foundation excise taxes under sections 
4941-4945.
Check this box to attest that your organizing document contains the provisions required by section 508(e) or that your organizing document 
does not need to include the provisions required by section 508(e) because you rely on the operation of state law in your particular state to 
meet the requirements of section 508(e). (See the instructions for explanation of the section 508(e) requirements.)
