Instructions to Winner
Box 1. The payer must furnish a Form W-2G to you if you 
receive:
1. $1,200 or more in gambling winnings from bingo or 
slot machines;
2. $1,500 or more in winnings (reduced by the wager) 
from keno;
3. More than $5,000 in winnings (reduced by the wager 
or buy-in) from a poker tournament;
4. $600 or more in gambling winnings (except winnings 
from bingo, keno, slot machines, and poker tournaments) 
and the payout is at least 300 times the amount of the 
wager; or
5. Any other gambling winnings subject to federal 
income tax withholding.
Generally, report all gambling winnings on the “Other 
income” line of Schedule 1 (Form 1040). You can deduct 
gambling losses as an itemized deduction, but you cannot 
deduct more than your winnings. Keep an accurate record 
of your winnings and losses, and be able to prove those 
amounts with receipts, tickets, statements, or similar items 
that you have saved. For additional information, see Pub. 
529, Miscellaneous Deductions; and Pub. 525, Taxable 
and Nontaxable Income.
Box 4. Any federal income tax withheld on these winnings 
is shown in this box. Federal income tax must be withheld 
on certain winnings less the wager.
Certain winnings that are not subject to regular gambling 
withholding may be subject to backup withholding if you 
did not provide your federal identification number to the 
payer.
Include the amount shown in box 4 on your Form 1040 
or 1040-SR as federal income tax withheld. See Pub. 505, 
Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax, for additional 
information.
Signature. You must sign Form W-2G if you are the only 
person entitled to the winnings and the winnings are 
subject to regular gambling withholding. Return the signed 
form to the payer, who will give you your copies.
Other winners. Prepare Form 5754, Statement by Person(s) 
Receiving Gambling Winnings, if another person is entitled 
to any part of these winnings. Give Form 5754 to the payer, 
who will use Form 5754 to prepare Form W-2G for each 
person listed as a winner.
Future developments. For the latest information about 
developments related to Form W-2G and its instructions, 
such as legislation enacted after they were published, go
