Instructions for Recipient
Recipient’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your protection, this 
form may show only the last four digits of your TIN (social security number 
(SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), or adoption taxpayer 
identification number (ATIN)). However, the payer has reported your complete 
TIN to the IRS.
Account number. May show an account or other unique number the payer has 
assigned to distinguish your account.
Box 1. Shows the gross distribution paid to you this year from an Achieving a 
Better Life Experience (ABLE) savings account in the calendar year being 
reported. Gross distribution includes distributions from the ABLE account for 
both qualified and nonqualified disability expenses. The gross distribution also 
includes amounts distributed that the designated beneficiary intends to roll over 
to another ABLE account, but does not include program-to-program transfers. A 
gross distribution also includes a return of excess contributions plus earnings.
Box 2. Shows the earnings part of the gross distribution shown in box 1. 
Generally, amounts distributed that are used to pay for qualified disability 
expenses, or rolled over to another ABLE account within 60 days, are not 
included in income. Report taxable amounts as “Other income” on Form 1040 or 
1040-SR. Also see Form 5329 and its separate instructions.
Box 3. Shows your basis in the gross distribution reported in box 1.
Box 4. This box is checked if a program-to-program transfer was made from 
this ABLE account to another ABLE account.
Box 5. This box is checked if the ABLE account was terminated in the calendar 
year being reported.
Box 6. The designated beneficiary is the individual named in the document 
creating the ABLE account to receive the benefit of the funds in the account. If 
this box is checked, you are not the designated beneficiary of this ABLE 
account. You and/or the designated beneficiary may be subject to additional 
taxes and/or penalties on the box 1 gross distribution. See Form 5329 and its 
separate instructions and the Instructions for Form 1040.
