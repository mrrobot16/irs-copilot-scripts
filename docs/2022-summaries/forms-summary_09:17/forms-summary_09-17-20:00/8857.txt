(Rev. June 2021)

Internal Revenue Service  (99) 
Request for Innocent Spouse Relief 
▶ Go to www.irs.gov/Form8857 for instructions and the latest information. 
OMB No. 1545-1596 
IMPORTANT THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW
• Do not file this form with your tax return. See Where To File in the instructions.
• See the instructions for this form and Pub. 971, Innocent Spouse Relief, for help in completing this form and for a 
description of the factors the IRS takes into account in deciding whether to grant innocent spouse relief. The Form 8857 
instructions and Pub. 971 are available at www.irs.gov.
• Attach the complete copy of any document requested or that you otherwise believe will support your request for relief.
• The IRS is required by law to notify the person listed on line 6 that you have requested this relief. That person will have 
the opportunity to participate in the process by completing a questionnaire about the tax years you enter on line 3 (the 
years for which you want innocent spouse relief). 
• The IRS will not disclose the following information: your current name, address, phone numbers, or employer(s).
• Note: If you petition the Tax Court to review your request for relief, the Tax Court may only be allowed to consider 
information you or the person on line 6 provided us before we made our final determination, additional information we 
included in our administrative file about your request for relief, and any information that is newly discovered or previously 
unavailable. Therefore, it is important that you provide us with all information you want us or the Tax Court to consider.
Note: If you need more room to write your answer for any question, attach more pages. Be sure to write your name and social 
security number on the top of all pages you attach.
Part I 
Should you file this form?
Generally, both taxpayers who file a joint return are responsible, jointly and individually, for paying any tax, interest, or penalties 
from your joint return. If you believe the person with whom you filed a joint return should be solely responsible for an erroneous 
item or an underpayment of tax from your joint tax return, you may be eligible for innocent spouse relief.
Innocent spouse relief may also be available if you were a resident of a community property state (see list of community property 
states in the instructions) and did not file a joint federal income tax return and you believe you should not be held responsible for 
the tax attributable to an item of community income.
1
Do either of the paragraphs above describe your situation?
Yes. You can file this Form 8857. Go to line 2.
No.  Do not file this Form 8857, but go to line 2 to see if you can file a different form.
2 
Did the IRS take your share of a joint refund from any tax year to pay any of the following past-due debt(s) owed ONLY 
by the person listed on line 6?
• Child support
• Spousal support
• Student loan (or other federal nontax debt)
• Federal or state taxes
Yes. You may be able to get back your share of the refund. See Form 8379, Injured Spouse Allocation, and its instructions. 
Go to line 3 if you answered “Yes” to line 1. 
No. Go to line 3 if you answered “Yes” to line 1. If you answered “No” to line 1, do not file this form.
3 
If you determine you should file this form, enter each tax year you want innocent spouse relief. It is important to enter the correct 
year. For example, if the IRS used your 2020 income tax refund to pay a 2018 joint tax liability, enter tax year 2018, not tax year 2020.
