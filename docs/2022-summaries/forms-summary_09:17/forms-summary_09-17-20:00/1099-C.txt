Form  1099-C (Rev. 1-2022)
(keep for your records)
www.irs.gov/Form1099C
Instructions for Debtor
You received this form because a federal government agency or an applicable 
financial entity (a creditor) has discharged (canceled or forgiven) a debt you 
owed, or because an identifiable event has occurred that either is or is deemed 
to be a discharge of a debt of $600 or more. If a creditor has discharged a debt 
you owed, you are required to include the discharged amount in your income, 
even if it is less than $600, on the “Other income” line of your Form 1040 or 
1040-SR. However, you may not have to include all of the canceled debt in your 
income. There are exceptions and exclusions, such as bankruptcy and 
insolvency. See Pub. 4681, available at www.irs.gov/Pub4681, for more details. 
If an identifiable event has occurred but the debt has not actually been 
discharged, then include any discharged debt in your income in the year that it 
is actually discharged, unless an exception or exclusion applies to you in that 
year. 
Debtor’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your protection, this form 
may show only the last four digits of your TIN (social security number (SSN), 
individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification 
number (ATIN), or employer identification number (EIN)). However, the creditor 
has reported your complete TIN to the IRS.
Account number. May show an account or other unique number the creditor 
assigned to distinguish your account.  
Box 1. Shows the date the earliest identifiable event occurred or, at the 
creditor’s discretion, the date of an actual discharge that occurred before an 
identifiable event. See the code in box 6. 
Box 2. Shows the amount of debt either actually or deemed discharged. Note: If 
you don’t agree with the amount, contact your creditor.  
Box 3. Shows interest if included in the debt reported in box 2. See Pub. 4681 to
see if you must include the interest in gross income.
Box 4. Shows a description of the debt. If box 7 is completed, box 4 also shows 
a description of the property. 
Box 5. Shows whether you were personally liable for repayment of the debt 
when the debt was created or, if modified, at the time of the last modification. 
See Pub. 4681 for reporting instructions.  
Box 6. Shows the reason your creditor has filed this form. The codes in this box 
are described in more detail in Pub. 4681. A—Bankruptcy; B—Other judicial 
debt relief; C—Statute of limitations or expiration of deficiency period; D—
Foreclosure election; E—Debt relief from probate or similar proceeding; F—By 
agreement; G—Decision or policy to discontinue collection; or H—Other actual 
discharge before identifiable event.  
Box 7. If, in the same calendar year, a foreclosure or abandonment of property 
occurred in connection with the cancellation of the debt, the fair market value 
(FMV) of the property will be shown, or you will receive a separate Form 1099-A. 
Generally, the gross foreclosure bid price is considered to be the FMV. For an 
abandonment or voluntary conveyance in lieu of foreclosure, the FMV is 
generally the appraised value of the property. You may have income or loss 
because of the acquisition or abandonment. See Pub. 4681 for information 
about foreclosures and abandonments. If the property was your main home, see 
Pub. 523 to figure any taxable gain or ordinary income.

Form 1099-C and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were 
published, go to www.irs.gov/Form1099C.
