Form 1097-BTC (Rev. 12-2019)
(keep for your records)
www.irs.gov/Form1097BTC
Instructions for Recipient
Issuers of certain tax credit bonds or their agents, and recipients of 
Form 1097-BTC from the bond issuer or agent who are further 
distributing the credit, such as brokers, nominees, mutual funds, or 
partnerships, must report to you on at least a quarterly basis and file 
with the IRS annually on a separate Form 1097-BTC the amount of tax 
credit you are allowed for each month of the calendar year. 
Recipient’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your 
protection, this form may show only the last four digits of your TIN 
(social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification 
number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or 
employer identification number (EIN)). However, the issuer has 
reported your complete TIN to the IRS.
▲
!
CAUTION
You will not receive a separate 4th quarter report. The 
credits for the 4th quarter will be reported together with the 
annual aggregate total amount of allowable credits 
furnished to you on or before the 15th day of the 2nd 
calendar month after the close of the calendar year.
Note: The first 3 quarters reported on the annual report are duplicative 
amounts previously reported. You are allowed to take the credit 
amount from each quarter only once.
The checkbox shows if the filer is the issuer of the bond or its agent, 
or is an entity or a person that received or should have received this 
form and is making a further distribution of the credit.
Box 1. Shows the aggregate total of credits allowed for the calendar 
year. 
Box 2a. Indicates if the unique identification number is your account 
number, the CUSIP number of the bond, or another identifier. For 
filings of Form 1097-BTC by the issuer of the bond or its agent (as 
indicated by the first checkbox being checked), the first nine 
characters of the unique identifier in box 2b must be the CUSIP 
number, if available. For further identification, if necessary or desired 
by the issuer, the CUSIP number can be followed by an optional 
hyphen and then an account number or other unique identifying 
number.
If no CUSIP number is available, the account number, or other 
unique identifying number by which the bond transaction is tracked by 
the issuer, is shown in box 2b.
C—CUSIP number
A—Account number
O—Any other identifier 
Box 2b. Shows the unique identifier assigned by the Form 1097-BTC 
issuer, limited to 39 alphanumeric characters. 
Box 3. Shows the codes for tax credit bonds that are reported on 
separate Forms 1097-BTC:
101—Clean renewable energy bond
199—Other
Boxes 5a–5l. These boxes show the amount of the credit you are 
allowed for the month during the calendar year.
You may be entitled to claim a credit against your income tax 
liabilities, subject to certain limitations under section 54A(c).
Additionally, clean renewable energy bond credits received from a 
pass-through entity are limited to the income received from the pass-
through entity. New clean renewable energy bond and qualified 
energy conservation bond credits are limited to 70% of the credit 
amounts determined under section 54A(b); the credit reported on 
Form 1097-BTC is the credit amount after the 70% limit has been 
applied. For more information, see Form 8912.
Box 6. May show any additional information provided by the form 
issuer.

developments related to Form 1097-BTC and its instructions, such as

Returns, and

Filing and furnishing. Furnish the information shown on 
Copy B of this form to the recipient on or before the 15th 
day of the 2nd calendar month after the close of the 
calendar quarter in which the credit is allowed. 
For the first 3 quarters, report to the recipient only the 
amounts for the months of the applicable quarter. Box 1 
should not be completed and box 6 is optional.
You are not required to furnish a separate report solely 
for the 4th quarter because the 4th quarter amounts are 
reported with the annual filing. For the annual filing, report 
the credits for each month in boxes 5a–5l, report the total 
of those amounts in box 1, and complete the rest of the 
form as applicable. If any amounts previously furnished for 
the first 3 quarters need to be corrected, report the correct 
amounts for the annual reporting and explain the correction 
to the recipient; no explanation is required for the IRS filing. 
 For the report furnished to the recipient (quarterly or 
annual), you may use Copy B or your own substitute 
statement reporting all the same applicable information 
(the reporting for the first 3 quarters may be furnished 
electronically). 
The IRS encourages Form 1097-BTC issuers to provide 
the credit information to the recipient monthly, if 
applicable, and as soon after the end of the month in which 
a credit arises as possible.
For filing and furnishing instructions, and to request filing 
or furnishing extensions, see the current General  
Instructions for Certain Information Returns. To file 
electronically, you must have software that generates a file 
according to the specifications in Pub. 1220.
