Form  1098-C (Rev. 11-2019)
(keep for your records)
www.irs.gov/Form1098C
Instructions for Donor 
Caution: You must attach Copy B of Form 1098-C to  
your income tax return in order to take a deduction for  
the contribution of a qualified vehicle with a claimed  
value of more than $500. (If you e-file your return, you  
must (a) attach Copy B of Form 1098-C to Form 8453 
and mail the forms to the IRS, or (b) include              
Form 1098-C as a PDF attachment if your software 
program permits.) If you do not attach Copy B of Form 
1098-C to your return (or to Form 8453) when required, 
the IRS will disallow your deduction. Generally, you 
must also attach Form 8283, Noncash Charitable 
Contributions, if the amount you deduct for all noncash 
gifts is more than $500. See the Instructions for Form 
8283 for exceptions. 
You received Form 1098-C because you donated a  
motor vehicle, boat, or airplane (“donated vehicle”) to 
the charity shown on the front of this form. Generally, 
the charity must furnish this form to you no later than 30 
days after the date it sold the donated vehicle (if box 4a 
is checked) or 30 days after the date of the contribution 
(if box 5a or 5b is checked). If none of these boxes is 
checked, you must obtain this form by the due date 
(including extensions) of your tax return for the year of 
the contribution (or, if earlier, the date you file that 
return). 
Donor’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For 
your protection, this form may show only the last four 
digits of your TIN (social security number (SSN), 
individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption 
taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or employer 
identification number (EIN)). However, the issuer has 
reported your complete TIN to the IRS.
Box 1. Shows the date the charity received the  
donated vehicle. 
Boxes 2a–2d. Shows the vehicle odometer mileage 
reading (motor vehicles only), make, model, and year of 
the donated vehicle.
Box 3. Shows the vehicle identification number (VIN) for 
a motor vehicle, the hull identification number for a 
boat, or the aircraft identification number for an airplane. 
Box 4a. This box is required to be checked by the 
charity to certify that the donated vehicle was sold for 
more than $500 to an unrelated party in an arm’s length 
transaction. 
Box 4c. Shows the gross proceeds the charity received 
from the sale of the donated vehicle. If box 4a is 
checked, you generally can take a deduction equal to 
the smaller of the amount in box 4c or the vehicle’s fair 
market value (FMV) on the date of the contribution. 
However, if that value was more than your cost or other 
basis, see Pub. 526, Charitable Contributions. 
Box 5a. This box is required to be checked by the 
charity to certify that the donated vehicle will not be 
sold before completion of a significant intervening use 
or material improvement by the charity. If the box is 
checked, you generally can take a deduction equal to 
the vehicle’s FMV on the date of the contribution. 
However, if that value was more than your cost or other 
basis, see Pub. 526. 
Box 5b. This box is required to be checked by the  
charity to certify that the donated vehicle is to be  
transferred to a needy individual in direct furtherance of 
the donee’s charitable purpose of relieving the poor and 
distressed or underprivileged who are in need of a 
means of transportation. If this box is checked, you 
generally can take a deduction equal to the vehicle’s 
FMV on the date of the contribution. However, if that 
value was more than your cost or other basis, see    
Pub. 526. 
Box 6b. Shows a good faith estimate by the charity of  
the value of any goods and services provided to you for 
the donated vehicle. Generally, the amount of your  
charitable contribution is reduced by the value of the  
goods and services provided. However, see the  
instructions for box 6c below. Also, see Contributions  
From Which You Benefit in Pub. 526. 
Box 6c. This box is required to be checked by the 
charity if the goods and services consisted solely of 
intangible religious benefits. If checked, you do not have 
to reduce the amount of your charitable contribution by 
the value of such benefits. An intangible religious benefit 
means a benefit that generally is not sold in a 
commercial transaction, such as admission to a 
religious ceremony. 
Box 7. If this box is checked, your deduction in most  
cases equals the smaller of $500 or the donated  
vehicle’s FMV on the date of the contribution. However, 
if that value was more than your cost or other basis, see 
Pub. 526.
