Form 1099-K (Rev. 1-2022)
(Keep for your records)
www.irs.gov/Form1099K 
Instructions for Payee
You have received this form because you have either (a) accepted 
payment cards for payments, or (b) received payments through a third 
party network in the calendar year reported on this form. Merchant 
acquirers and third party settlement organizations, as payment 
settlement entities (PSEs), must report the proceeds of payment card 
and third party network transactions made to you on Form 1099-K 
under Internal Revenue Code section 6050W. The PSE may have 
contracted with an electronic payment facilitator (EPF) or other third 
party payer to make payments to you. 
If you have questions about the amounts reported on this form, 
contact the FILER whose information is shown in the upper left corner 
on the front of this form. If you do not recognize the FILER shown in 
the upper left corner of the form, contact the PSE whose name and 
phone number are shown in the lower left corner of the form above 
your account number. 
If the Form 1099-K is related to your business, see Pub. 334 for 
more information. If the Form 1099-K is related to your work as part of 
the gig economy, see www.irs.gov/GigEconomy.
See the separate instructions for your income tax return for using 
the information reported on this form.
Payee’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your protection, 
this form may show only the last four digits of your TIN (social security 
number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), 
adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or employer 
identification number (EIN)). However, the issuer has reported your 
complete TIN to the IRS. 
Account number. May show an account number or other unique 
number the PSE assigned to distinguish your account. 
Box 1a. Shows the aggregate gross amount of payment card/third 
party network transactions made to you through the PSE during the 
calendar year. 
Box 1b. Shows the aggregate gross amount of all reportable payment 
transactions made to you through the PSE during the calendar year 
where the card was not present at the time of the transaction or the 
card number was keyed into the terminal. Typically, this relates to 
online sales, phone sales, or catalogue sales. If the box for third party 
network is checked, or if these are third party network transactions, 
Card Not Present transactions will not be reported. 
Box 2. Shows the merchant category code used for payment card/
third party network transactions (if available) reported on this form. 
Box 3. Shows the number of payment transactions (not including 
refund transactions) processed through the payment card/third party 
network. 
Box 4. Shows backup withholding. Generally, a payer must backup 
withhold if you did not furnish your TIN or you did not furnish the 
correct TIN to the payer. See Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer 
Identification Number and Certification, and Pub. 505. Include this 
amount on your income tax return as tax withheld.
Boxes 5a–5l. Show the gross amount of payment card/third party 
network transactions made to you for each month of the calendar 
year. 
Boxes 6–8. Show state and local income tax withheld from the 
payments.
