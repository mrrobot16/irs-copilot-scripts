▶ Go to www.irs.gov/Form9465 for instructions and the latest information. 
▶ If you are filing this form with your tax return, attach it to the front of the return.  
▶ See separate instructions. 
OMB No. 1545-0074
Tip: If you owe $50,000 or less, you may be able to avoid filing Form 9465 and establish an installment agreement online, even if you 
haven’t yet received a tax bill. Go to www.irs.gov/OPA to apply for an Online Payment Agreement. If you establish your installment 
agreement using the Online Payment Agreement application, the user fee that you pay will be lower than it would be with Form 9465.
