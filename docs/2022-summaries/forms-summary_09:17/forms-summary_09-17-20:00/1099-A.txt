Form 1099-A (Rev. 1-2022)
(keep for your records)
www.irs.gov/Form1099A
Instructions for Borrower
Certain lenders who acquire an interest in property that was security for a loan 
or who have reason to know that such property has been abandoned must 
provide you with this statement. You may have reportable income or loss 
because of such acquisition or abandonment. Gain or loss from an acquisition is 
generally measured by the difference between your adjusted basis in the 
property and the amount of your debt canceled in exchange for the property or, 
if greater, the sale proceeds. If you abandoned the property, you may have 
income from the discharge of indebtedness in the amount of the unpaid balance 
of your canceled debt. The tax consequences of abandoning property depend 
on whether or not you were personally liable for the debt. Losses on acquisitions 
or abandonments of property held for personal use are not deductible. See Pub. 
4681 for information about your tax consequences.
Property means any real property (such as a personal residence), any 
intangible property, and tangible personal property that is held for investment or 
used in a trade or business.
If you borrowed money on this property with someone else, each of you 
should receive this statement.
Borrower’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your protection, this 
form may show only the last four digits of your TIN (social security number 
(SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer 
identification number (ATIN), or employer identification number (EIN)). However, 
the issuer has reported your complete TIN to the IRS.
Account number. May show an account or other unique number the lender 
assigned to distinguish your account.
Box 1. For a lender’s acquisition of property that was security for a loan, the 
date shown is generally the earlier of the date title was transferred to the lender 
or the date possession and the burdens and benefits of ownership were 
transferred to the lender. This may be the date of a foreclosure or execution sale 
or the date your right of redemption or objection expired. For an abandonment, 
the date shown is the date on which the lender first knew or had reason to know 
that the property was abandoned or the date of a foreclosure, execution, or 
similar sale.
Box 2. Shows the debt (principal only) owed to the lender on the loan when the 
interest in the property was acquired by the lender or on the date the lender first 
knew or had reason to know that the property was abandoned.
Box 3. Reserved for future use.
Box 4. Shows the fair market value of the property. If the amount in box 4 is less 
than the amount in box 2, and your debt is canceled, you may have cancellation 
of debt income. If the property was your main home, see Pub. 523 to figure any 
taxable gain or ordinary income.
Box 5. Shows whether you were personally liable for repayment of the debt 
when the debt was created or, if modified, when it was last modified.
Box 6. Shows the description of the property acquired by the lender or 
abandoned by you. If “CCC” is shown, the form indicates the amount of any 
Commodity Credit Corporation loan outstanding when you forfeited your 
commodity.

Form 1099-A and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were 
published, go to www.irs.gov/Form1099A.
