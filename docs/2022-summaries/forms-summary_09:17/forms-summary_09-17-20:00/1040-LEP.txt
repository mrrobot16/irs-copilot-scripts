Purpose of Form
The IRS is committed to providing taxpayers with limited English 
proficiency meaningful access to information regarding their 
taxpayer rights and responsibilities. Use Schedule LEP to 
request written communications from the IRS in an alternative 
language.
TIP
Basic information about filing your return and paying 
taxes is available in different languages. See 
www.irs.gov/MyLanguage.
Written communications. Different forms of written 
communications are issued by the IRS, such as correspondence 
and other printed material. These may include notifications sent 
to an individual taxpayer, including formal letters and notices, as 
well as general correspondence, tax forms, instructions, or 
publications. Generally, any inserts enclosed with the written 
communication will also be provided in the requested language.

CAUTION
You may not immediately receive written 
communications in the requested language. The IRS’s 
commitment to LEP taxpayers is part of a multiyear 
timeline that is scheduled to begin providing 
translations in 2023. You will continue to receive 
communications, including notices and letters, in English until 
they are translated to your preferred language.
Who Can File
Schedule LEP is not mandatory but can be filed with a tax return 
by taxpayers with limited English proficiency to indicate their 
language of preference for IRS-issued written communications 
or change their language of preference.
How To File
File Schedule LEP with your income tax return. You can state 
this preference only by filing Schedule LEP with your income tax 
return. If you e-file Schedule LEP with your tax return, don’t file 
the paper version of this form. See www.irs.gov/efile. File 
Schedule LEP with your current year tax return or any 
subsequent year returns, but not any year prior to 2020.
Name
Enter the name exactly as it appears on your tax return. 
Joint Return
If you and your spouse are filing a joint return, file a Schedule 
LEP with your tax return for each spouse who prefers an 
alternative language. If both spouses would prefer to receive 
written communications in an alternative language other than 
English, file a separate form for each spouse, even if both 
spouses prefer the same alternative language. 
Social Security Number (SSN)
The SSN entered on this form should match the SSN listed on 
your tax return. If you’re married and file a joint return, enter the 
SSN only of the spouse making the request. If you’re a 
nonresident or resident alien and you don’t have and aren’t 
eligible to get an SSN, you must apply for an individual taxpayer 
identification number (ITIN). To obtain an ITIN, you must 
complete Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer 
Identification Number. If you already have an ITIN, enter it 
wherever your SSN is requested. See www.irs.gov/ITIN.
Line 1
Select one of the listed languages if you would prefer to receive 
future written communications in that language. Select only one 
of the listed options by checking the appropriate box. If you 
would like to cancel a previous election, select English. Your 
selection will be effective for future written communications, 
including correspondence with respect to other tax years, until 
the selection is changed or cancelled. 
TIP
Special assistance is available for persons with limited 
English proficiency. If you’re unable to complete your 
tax return, you may be able to obtain assistance from 
the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance  
or Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs sponsored by the 
IRS. See www.irs.gov/VITA.
