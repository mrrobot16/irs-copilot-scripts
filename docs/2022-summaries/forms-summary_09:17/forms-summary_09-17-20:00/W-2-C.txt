Corrected Wage and Tax Statement
Copy C—For EMPLOYEE’s RECORDS 
Department of the Treasury 
Internal Revenue Service 
Notice to Employee
This is a corrected Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, 
(or Form W-2AS, W-2CM, W-2GU, W-2VI or W-2c) for the 
tax year shown in box c. If you have filed an income tax 
return for the year shown, you may have to file an 
amended return. Compare amounts on this form with 
those reported on your income tax return. If the corrected 
amounts change your U.S. income tax, file Form 1040X, 
Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, with Copy B 
of this Form W-2c to amend the return you already filed. 
If there is a correction in box 5, Medicare wages and 
tips, use the corrected amount to determine if you need 
to file or amend Form 8959, Additional Medicare Tax. If 
you need to file Form 8959 or an amended Form 8959, 
attach it to Form 1040 or Form 1040X, as applicable.
If you have not filed your return for the year shown in 
box c, attach Copy B of the original Form W-2 you 
received from your employer and Copy B of this Form 
W-2c to your return when you file it. 
For more information, contact your nearest Internal 
Revenue Service office. Employees in American Samoa, 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, 
or the U.S. Virgin Islands should contact their local taxing 
authority for more information.

E-filing.  If you file 250 or more Form(s) W-2c, you must 
file electronically. Even if you are not required to file 
electronically, doing so can save you time and effort. 
Employers may now use the SSA's W-2 Online service to 
create, save, print and submit up to 50 Form(s) W-2c at a 
time over the Internet. When you e-file with the SSA, no 
separate Form W-3c filing is required.  An electronic Form 
W-3c will be created for you by the W-2 Online service.
