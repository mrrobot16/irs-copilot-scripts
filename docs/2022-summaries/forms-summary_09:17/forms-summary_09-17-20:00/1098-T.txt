Instructions for Student
You, or the person who can claim you as a dependent, may be able to claim an 
education credit on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. This statement has been furnished 
to you by an eligible educational institution in which you are enrolled, or by an 
insurer who makes reimbursements or refunds of qualified tuition and related 
expenses to you. This statement is required to support any claim for an 
education credit. Retain this statement for your records. To see if you qualify for 
a credit, and for help in calculating the amount of your credit, see Pub. 970, 
Form 8863, and the Instructions for Form 1040. Also, for more information, go to 
www.irs.gov/Credits-Deductions/Individuals/Qualified-Ed-Expenses.
Your institution must include its name, address, and information contact telephone 
number on this statement. It may also include contact information for a service provider. 
Although the filer or the service provider may be able to answer certain questions about 
the statement, do not contact the filer or the service provider for explanations of the 
requirements for (and how to figure) any education credit that you may claim.
Student’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your protection, this form may 
show only the last four digits of your TIN (SSN, ITIN, ATIN, or EIN). However, the issuer 
has reported your complete TIN to the IRS. Caution: If your TIN is not shown in this box, 
your school was not able to provide it. Contact your school if you have questions.
Account number. May show an account or other unique number the filer 
assigned to distinguish your account.
Box 1. Shows the total payments received by an eligible educational institution in 2023 
from any source for qualified tuition and related expenses less any reimbursements or 
refunds made during 2023 that relate to those payments received during 2023.
Box 2. Reserved for future use.
Box 3. Reserved for future use.
Box 4. Shows any adjustment made by an eligible educational institution for a 
prior year for qualified tuition and related expenses that were reported on a 
prior year Form 1098-T. This amount may reduce any allowable education credit
that you claimed for the prior year (may result in an increase in tax liability for the 
year of the refund). See “recapture” in the index to Pub. 970 to report a 
reduction in your education credit or tuition and fees deduction.
Box 5. Shows the total of all scholarships or grants administered and processed 
by the eligible educational institution. The amount of scholarships or grants for 
the calendar year (including those not reported by the institution) may reduce 
the amount of the education credit you claim for the year. 
TIP: You may be able to increase the combined value of an education credit and certain 
educational assistance (including Pell Grants) if the student includes some or all of the 
educational assistance in income in the year it is received. For details, see Pub. 970.
Box 6. Shows adjustments to scholarships or grants for a prior year. This 
amount may affect the amount of any allowable tuition and fees deduction or 
education credit that you claimed for the prior year. You may have to file an 
amended income tax return (Form 1040-X) for the prior year. 
Box 7. Shows whether the amount in box 1 includes amounts for an academic period 
beginning January–March 2024. See Pub. 970 for how to report these amounts.
Box 8. Shows whether you are considered to be carrying at least one-half the 
normal full-time workload for your course of study at the reporting institution. 
Box 9. Shows whether you are considered to be enrolled in a program leading 
to a graduate degree, graduate-level certificate, or other recognized graduate-
level educational credential. 
Box 10. Shows the total amount of reimbursements or refunds of qualified tuition 
and related expenses made by an insurer. The amount of reimbursements or refunds 
for the calendar year may reduce the amount of any education credit you can claim 
for the year (may result in an increase in tax liability for the year of the refund).
