return, or
• You’re a monthly schedule depositor making a payment 
in accordance with the Accuracy of Deposits Rule. See

of your payment may be $2,500 or more.
Otherwise, you must make deposits by electronic funds 
transfer. See section 11 of Pub. 15 for deposit 
instructions. Don’t use Form 945-V to make federal tax
