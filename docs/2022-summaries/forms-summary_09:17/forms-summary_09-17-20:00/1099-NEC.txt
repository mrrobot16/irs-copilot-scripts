Instructions for Recipient
You received this form instead of Form W-2 because the payer did not 
consider you an employee and did not withhold income tax or social 
security and Medicare tax.
If you believe you are an employee and cannot get the payer to correct 
this form, report the amount shown in box 1 on the line for “Wages, 
salaries, tips, etc.” of Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. You must also 
complete Form 8919 and attach it to your return. For more information, see 
Pub. 1779, Independent Contractor or Employee.
If you are not an employee but the amount in box 1 is not self-
employment (SE) income (for example, it is income from a sporadic activity 
or a hobby), report the amount shown in box 1 on the “Other income” line 
(on Schedule 1 (Form 1040)).
Recipient’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your protection, this 
form may show only the last four digits of your TIN (social security number 
(SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer 
identification number (ATIN), or employer identification number (EIN)). 
However, the issuer has reported your complete TIN to the IRS.
Account number. May show an account or other unique number the payer 
assigned to distinguish your account.
Box 1. Shows nonemployee compensation. If the amount in this box is SE 
income, report it on Schedule C or F (Form 1040) if a sole proprietor, or on 
Form 1065 and Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) if a partnership, and the 
recipient/partner completes Schedule SE (Form 1040).
Note: If you are receiving payments on which no income, social security, 
and Medicare taxes are withheld, you should make estimated tax 
payments. See Form 1040-ES (or Form 1040-ES (NR)). Individuals must 
report these amounts as explained in these box 1 instructions. 
Corporations, fiduciaries, and partnerships must report these amounts on 
the appropriate line of their tax returns.
Box 2. If checked, consumer products totaling $5,000 or more were sold 
to you for resale, on a buy-sell, a deposit-commission, or other basis. 
Generally, report any income from your sale of these products on 
Schedule C (Form 1040).
Box 3. Reserved for future use.
Box 4. Shows backup withholding. A payer must backup withhold on 
certain payments if you did not give your TIN to the payer. See Form W-9, 
Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, for 
information on backup withholding. Include this amount on your income 
tax return as tax withheld.
Boxes 5–7. State income tax withheld reporting boxes.
