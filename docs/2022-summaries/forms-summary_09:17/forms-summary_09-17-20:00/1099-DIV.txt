Form 1099-DIV (Rev. 1-2022)
(keep for your records) 
www.irs.gov/Form1099DIV
Instructions for Recipient 
Recipient’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For your protection, this 
form may show only the last four digits of your TIN (SSN, ITIN, ATIN, or EIN). 
However, the issuer has reported your complete TIN to the IRS.
Account number. May show an account or other unique number the payer 
assigned to distinguish your account. 
Box 1a. Shows total ordinary dividends that are taxable. Include this amount on 
the “Ordinary dividends” line of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Also report it on 
Schedule B (Form 1040), if required. 
Box 1b. Shows the portion of the amount in box 1a that may be eligible for 
reduced capital gains rates. See the Instructions for Form 1040 for how to 
determine this amount and where to report.  
The amount shown may be dividends a corporation paid directly to you as a 
participant (or beneficiary of a participant) in an employee stock ownership plan 
(ESOP). Report it as a dividend on your Form 1040 or 1040-SR but treat it as a 
plan distribution, not as investment income, for any other purpose. 
Box 2a. Shows total capital gain distributions from a regulated investment 
company (RIC) or real estate investment trust (REIT). See How To Report in the 
Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). But, if no amount is shown in boxes 2b, 
2c, 2d, and 2f and your only capital gains and losses are capital gain distributions, 
you may be able to report the amounts shown in box 2a on your Form 1040 or 
1040-SR rather than Schedule D. See the Instructions for Form 1040. 
Box 2b. Shows the portion of the amount in box 2a that is unrecaptured section 
1250 gain from certain depreciable real property. See the Unrecaptured Section 
1250 Gain Worksheet in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). 
Box 2c. Shows the portion of the amount in box 2a that is section 1202 gain 
from certain small business stock that may be subject to an exclusion. See the 
Schedule D (Form 1040) instructions. 
Box 2d. Shows the portion of the amount in box 2a that is 28% rate gain from 
sales or exchanges of collectibles. If required, use this amount when completing 
the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040). 
Box 2e. Shows the portion of the amount in box 1a that is section 897 gain 
attributable to disposition of U.S. real property interests (USRPI). 
Box 2f. Shows the portion of the amount in box 2a that is section 897 gain 
attributable to disposition of USRPI.
Note: Boxes 2e and 2f apply only to foreign persons and entities whose income 
maintains its character when passed through or distributed to its direct or
indirect foreign owners or beneficiaries. It is generally treated as effectively 
connected to a trade or business within the United States. See the instructions 
for your tax return.
Box 3. Shows a return of capital. To the extent of your cost (or other basis) in 
the stock, the distribution reduces your basis and is not taxable. Any amount 
received in excess of your basis is taxable to you as capital gain. See Pub. 550.
Box 4. Shows backup withholding. A payer must backup withhold on certain 
payments if you did not give your TIN to the payer. See Form W-9  for 
information on backup withholding. Include this amount on your income tax 
return as tax withheld. 
Box 5. Shows the portion of the amount in box 1a that may be eligible for the 
20% qualified business income deduction under section 199A. See the 
instructions for Form 8995 and Form 8995-A.
Box 6. Shows your share of expenses of a nonpublicly offered RIC, generally a 
nonpublicly offered mutual fund. This amount is included in box 1a. 
Box 7. Shows the foreign tax that you may be able to claim as a deduction or a 
credit on Form 1040 or 1040-SR. See the Instructions for Form 1040. 
Box 8. This box should be left blank if a RIC reported the foreign tax shown in 
box 7. 
Boxes 9 and 10. Show cash and noncash liquidation distributions. 
Box 11. If the FATCA filing requirement box is checked, the payer is reporting 
on this Form 1099 to satisfy its account reporting requirement under chapter 4 
of the Internal Revenue Code. You may also have a filing requirement. See the 
Instructions for Form 8938.
Box 12. Shows exempt-interest dividends from a mutual fund or other RIC paid 
to you during the calendar year. See the Instructions for Form 1040 for where to 
report. This amount may be subject to backup withholding. See Box 4 above.
Box 13. Shows exempt-interest dividends subject to the alternative minimum 
tax. This amount is included in box 12. See the Instructions for Form 6251.
Boxes 14–16. State income tax withheld reporting boxes.
Nominees. If this form includes amounts belonging to another person, you are 
considered a nominee recipient. You must file Form 1099-DIV (with a Form 
1096) with the IRS for each of the other owners to show their share of the 
income, and you must furnish a Form 1099-DIV to each. A spouse is not 
required to file a nominee return to show amounts owned by the other spouse. 
See the current General Instructions for Certain Information Returns.
