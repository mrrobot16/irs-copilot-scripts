Part II 
Reasons for Filing. Check applicable boxes. If none apply, don’t file Form 2210.
A
You request a waiver (see instructions) of your entire penalty. You must check this box and file page 1 of Form 2210, but you
aren’t required to figure your penalty.
B
You request a waiver (see instructions) of part of your penalty. You must figure your penalty and waiver amount and file Form
2210.
C
Your income varied during the year and your penalty is reduced or eliminated when figured using the annualized income 
installment method. You must figure the penalty using Schedule Al and file Form 2210.
D
Your penalty is lower when figured by treating the federal income tax withheld from your income as paid on the dates it was 
actually withheld, instead of in equal amounts on the payment due dates. You must figure your penalty and file Form 2210.
E
You filed or are filing a joint return for either 2021 or 2022, but not for both years, and line 8 above is smaller than line 5
above. You must file page 1 of Form 2210, but you aren’t required to figure your penalty (unless box B, C, or D applies).
