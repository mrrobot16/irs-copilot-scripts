Part 3. Agreement to Special Valuation Under Section 2032A
There cannot be a valid election unless:
• The agreement is executed by each one of the qualified heirs, and
• The agreement is included with the estate tax return when the estate tax return is filed.
We (list all qualified heirs) 
,
being all the qualified heirs and (list all other persons having an interest in the property required to sign this agreement)
,
being all other parties having interests in the property, which is qualified real property and which is valued under section 2032A, do
hereby approve of the election made by

pursuant to section 2032A to value said property on the basis of the qualified use to which the property is devoted and do hereby 
enter into this agreement pursuant to section 2032A(d).
The undersigned agree and consent to the application of subsection (c) of section 2032A with respect to all the property described on 
Form 706, Schedule A-1, Part 2, line 2, attached to this agreement. More specifically, the undersigned heirs expressly agree and 
consent to personal liability under subsection (c) of 2032A for the additional estate and GST taxes imposed by that subsection with 
respect to their respective interests in the above-described property in the event of certain early dispositions of the property or early 
cessation of the qualified use of the property. It is understood that if a qualified heir disposes of any interest in qualified real property 
to any member of his or her family, such member may thereafter be treated as the qualified heir with respect to such interest upon 
filing a Form 706-A, United States Additional Estate Tax Return, and a new agreement.
The undersigned interested parties who are not qualified heirs consent to the collection of any additional estate and GST taxes 
imposed under section 2032A(c) from the specially valued property.
If there is a disposition of any interest which passes, or has passed to him or her, or if there is a cessation of the qualified use of any 
specially valued property which passes or passed to him or her, each of the undersigned heirs agrees to file a Form 706-A, and pay 
any additional estate and GST taxes due within 6 months of the disposition or cessation.
It is understood by all interested parties that this agreement is a condition precedent to the election of special-use valuation under 
section 2032A and must be executed by every interested party even though that person may not have received the estate (or GST) tax 
benefits or be in possession of such property.
Each of the undersigned understands that by making this election, a lien will be created and recorded pursuant to section 6324B on 
the property referred to in this agreement for the adjusted tax differences with respect to the estate as defined in section 2032A(c)(2)
(C).
As the interested parties, the undersigned designate the following individual as their agent for all dealings with the Internal Revenue 
Service concerning the continued qualification of the specially valued property under section 2032A and on all issues regarding the 
special lien under section 6324B. The agent is authorized to act for the parties with respect to all dealings with the Internal Revenue 
Service on matters affecting the qualified real property described earlier. This includes the authorization:
• To receive confidential information on all matters relating to continued qualification under section 2032A of the specially valued real 
property and on all matters relating to the special lien arising under section 6324B;
• To furnish the Internal Revenue Service with any requested information concerning the property;
• To notify the Internal Revenue Service of any disposition or cessation of qualified use of any part of the property;
• To receive, but not to endorse and collect, checks in payment of any refund of Internal Revenue taxes, penalties, or interest;
• To execute waivers (including offers of waivers) of restrictions on assessment or collection of deficiencies in tax and waivers of 
notice of disallowance of a claim for credit or refund; and
• To execute closing agreements under section 7121.

SCHEDULE J—Funeral Expenses and Expenses Incurred in Administering Property Subject to Claims 
▶ Use Schedule PC to make a protective claim for refund due to an expense not currently deductible. 
For such a claim, report the expense on Schedule J but without a value in the last column.
Note: Do not list expenses of administering property not subject to claims on this schedule. To report those expenses, see instructions.
If executors’ commissions, attorney fees, etc., are claimed and allowed as a deduction for estate tax purposes, they are not 
allowable as a deduction in computing the taxable income of the estate for federal income tax purposes. They are allowable as an 
income tax deduction on Form 1041, U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts, if a waiver is filed to forgo the deduction on 
Form 706. See the Instructions for Form 1041.
Are you aware of any actual or potential reimbursement to the estate for any expense claimed as a deduction on this
schedule? .

Department of the Treasury  
Internal Revenue Service 
Protective Claim for Refund 
▶ To be used for decedents dying after December 31, 2011. File 2 copies of this schedule with 
Form 706 for each pending claim or expense under section 2053.
OMB No. 1545-0015
• Timely filing a protective claim for refund preserves the estate’s right to claim a refund based on the amount of an unresolved claim 
or expense that may not become deductible under section 2053 until after the limitation period ends.
• Schedule PC can be used to file a protective claim for refund and, once the claim or expense becomes deductible, Schedule PC can 
be used to notify the IRS that a refund is being claimed.
• Schedule PC can be used by the estate of a decedent dying after 2011.
• Schedule PC must be filed with Form 706 and cannot be filed separately. (To file a protective claim for refund or notify the IRS that a 
refund is being claimed in a form separate from the Form 706, instead use Form 843, Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement.)
• Each separate claim or expense requires a separate Schedule PC (or Form 843, if not filed with Form 706).
• Schedule PC must be filed in duplicate (two copies) for each separate claim or expense.
