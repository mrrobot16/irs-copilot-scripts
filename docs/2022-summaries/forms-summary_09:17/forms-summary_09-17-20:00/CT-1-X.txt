Return You're Correcting ...
Enter the calendar year of the return 
you're correcting:
(YYYY)
Enter the date you discovered errors:
(MM / DD / YYYY)
Read the separate instructions before completing this form. Use this form to correct errors made on Form  CT-1, Employer’s Annual 
Railroad Retirement Tax Return. Use a separate Form CT-1 X for each year that needs correction. Type or print within the boxes. You 
MUST complete all five pages. Don’t attach this form to Form CT-1 unless you’re reclassifying workers; see the instructions for line 42.
Part 1:
Select ONLY one process. See page 6 for additional guidance, including information on how to treat employment 
tax credits and Tier 1 tax deferrals.
1. Adjusted railroad retirement tax return. Check this box if you underreported tax amounts. Also check this box if you overreported tax 
amounts and you would like to use the adjustment process to correct the errors. You must check this box if you’re correcting both 
underreported and overreported tax amounts on this form. The amount shown on line 26, if less than zero, may only be applied as a credit to 
your Form CT-1 for the tax period in which you’re filing this form.
2. Claim. Check this box if you overreported tax amounts only and you would like to use the claim process to ask for a refund or abatement of 
the amount shown on line 26. Don’t check this box if you're correcting ANY underreported tax amounts on this form.
Part 2:
Complete the certifications.
3. I certify that I’ve filed or will file Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, or Forms W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, as required.
Note: If you’re correcting underreported tax amounts only, go to Part 3 on page 2 and skip lines 4 and 5. If you’re correcting overreported tax 
amounts, for purposes of the certifications on lines 4 and 5, Employee Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA) taxes consist of Tier 1 Employee 
tax, Tier 1 Employee  Medicare tax, and Tier 2  Employee tax. Employer RRTA taxes consist of Tier 1 Employer tax, Tier 1 Employer Medicare 
tax, and Tier 2 Employer tax. Form CT-1 X can’t be used to correct overreported amounts of Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax unless 
the amounts weren’t withheld from employee compensation.
4. If you checked line 1 because you’re adjusting overreported amounts, check all that apply. You must check at least one box.
I certify that:
a. I repaid or reimbursed each affected employee for the overcollected RRTA taxes for prior years. I have a written statement from each 
affected employee stating that they haven’t claimed (or the claim was rejected) and won’t claim a refund or credit for the overcollection.
b. The adjustments are only for Employer RRTA taxes. I couldn’t find the affected employees or each affected employee didn’t give me a 
written statement that they haven’t claimed (or the claim was rejected) and won’t claim a refund or credit for the overcollection.
c. The adjustment is for RRTA taxes and/or Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax that I didn’t withhold from employee compensation.
5. If you checked line 2 because you’re claiming a refund or abatement of overreported RRTA taxes, check all that apply.  
You must check at least one box.
I certify that:
a. I repaid or reimbursed each affected employee for the overcollected Employee RRTA taxes for prior years. I have a written statement from 
each affected employee stating that they haven’t claimed (or the claim was rejected) and won’t claim a refund or credit for the 
overcollection.
b. I have a written consent from each affected employee stating that I may file this claim for Employee RRTA taxes overcollected in prior years. 
I also have a written statement from each affected employee stating that they haven’t claimed (or the claim was rejected) and won’t claim a 
refund or credit for the overcollection.
c. The claim is for Employer RRTA taxes only. I couldn’t find the affected employees; each affected employee didn’t give me a written consent 
to file a claim for Employee RRTA taxes; or each affected employee didn’t give me a written statement that they haven’t claimed (or the 
claim was rejected) and won’t claim a refund or credit for the overcollection.
d. The claim is for RRTA taxes and/or Tier 1 Employee Additional Medicare Tax that I didn’t withhold from employee compensation.
