Note: Generally, the corporation is not required to file Form 2220 (see Part II below for exceptions) because the IRS will figure any penalty 
owed and bill the corporation. However, the corporation may still use Form 2220 to figure the penalty. If so, enter the amount from page 2, 
line 38, on the estimated tax penalty line of the corporation’s income tax return, but do not attach Form 2220.
