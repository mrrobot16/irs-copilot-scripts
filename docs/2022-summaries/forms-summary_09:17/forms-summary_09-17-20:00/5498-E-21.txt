Instructions for Beneficiary
The information on Form 5498-ESA is furnished to you by 
the trustee or issuer of your Coverdell education savings 
account (ESA) by May 2, 2022. Form 5498-ESA reports 
contributions and rollover contributions made for you for 
2021. For more information about Coverdell ESAs, see 
Pub. 970.
Beneficiary’s taxpayer identification number (TIN). For 
your protection, this form may show only the last four digits 
of your TIN (social security number (SSN), individual 
taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer 
identification number (ATIN), or employer identification 
number (EIN)). However, the issuer has reported your 
complete TIN to the IRS.
Account number. May show an account or other unique 
number the trustee/issuer assigned to distinguish your 
account.
Box 1. Shows Coverdell ESA contributions made in 2021 
and through April 18, 2022, for 2021 on your behalf. Do not 
deduct these amounts on your income tax return.
If the total contributions made to all your Coverdell ESAs 
for 2021 exceeded $2,000, you must withdraw the excess, 
plus earnings, by June 1, 2022, or you may owe a penalty. 
You must keep track of your Coverdell ESA basis 
(contributions and distributions).
Box 2. Shows any rollover (including a direct rollover and 
contribution of a military death gratuity) you made in 2021. 
Generally, any amount rolled over from one Coverdell ESA 
to another Coverdell ESA for the benefit of the named 
beneficiary or a member of the beneficiary’s family who is 
under age 30 (except for a beneficiary with special needs) 
is not taxable.
