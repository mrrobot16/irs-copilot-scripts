Form 4136 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim a credit for federal tax paid on fuels. The form includes various sections for different types of fuel and their respective rates, gallons used, and amounts of credit. The form also requires the taxpayer to provide a credit reference number (CRN) for each claim. The types of fuel covered in the form include gasoline, aviation gasoline, undyed diesel fuel, undyed kerosene, kerosene used in aviation, sales by registered ultimate vendors of fuels, biodiesel/renewable diesel/sustainable aviation fuel mixtures, nontaxable use of alternative fuel, alternative fuel credit, registered credit card issuers, diesel-water fuel emulsion, diesel-water fuel emulsion blending, and exported dyed fuels and gasoline blendstocks. The total income tax credit claimed is calculated by adding up the amounts of credit claimed in each section and entering it on the appropriate line of the taxpayer's income tax return.
