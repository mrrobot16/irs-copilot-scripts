Form 5498-ESA is an information return form used to report contributions and rollover contributions made to a Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA). The form is divided into three copies: Copy A is filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) along with Form 1096, Copy B is furnished to the beneficiary of the ESA, and Copy C is for the trustee or issuer of the ESA.

The form includes sections to enter the trustee or issuer's name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN), as well as the beneficiary's name, address, and TIN. There is also a space to enter the account number assigned by the trustee or issuer.

Box 1 of the form shows the total contributions made to the ESA for the tax year, and Box 2 shows any rollover contributions made. The instructions state that contributions should not be deducted on the beneficiary's income tax return.

The form also provides information about the beneficiary's TIN and the requirement to withdraw any excess contributions by a certain deadline to avoid penalties. It advises the beneficiary to keep track of their ESA basis, which includes contributions and distributions.

The instructions for the beneficiary provide additional details about the form and its purpose, as well as information about Coverdell ESAs and where to find more information.

The instructions for the trustee or issuer provide guidance on how to complete the form, including references to the relevant IRS instructions and resources for assistance.

Overall, Form 5498-ESA is used to report and provide information about contributions and rollover contributions made to a Coverdell ESA for the tax year.
