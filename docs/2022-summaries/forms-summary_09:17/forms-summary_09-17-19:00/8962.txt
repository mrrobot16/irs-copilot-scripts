Form 8962 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim the Premium Tax Credit (PTC) and reconcile any advance payments of the PTC. The form is to be attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form is divided into several parts:

Part II: Premium Tax Credit Claim and Reconciliation of Advance Payment of Premium Tax Credit
- Taxpayers indicate if they are allocating policy amounts with another taxpayer or if they want to use the alternative calculation for the year of marriage.
- Depending on the response, taxpayers either skip to Part IV or Part V, or proceed to line 10.

Part III: Repayment of Excess Advance Payment of the Premium Tax Credit
- Taxpayers calculate the excess advance payment of the PTC, repayment limitation, and excess advance premium tax credit repayment.
