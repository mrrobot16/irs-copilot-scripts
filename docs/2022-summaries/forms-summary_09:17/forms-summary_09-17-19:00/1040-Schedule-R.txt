Schedule R (Form 1040) is a document used to claim the Credit for the Elderly or the Disabled on a tax return. This credit can be taken if the taxpayer is age 65 or older by the end of the tax year or if they are under age 65 and retired on permanent and total disability, and received taxable disability income. The document includes a series of checkboxes to determine the taxpayer's filing status and age, and provides instructions on how to complete the form based on the selected options. 

Part I of the form requires the taxpayer to check the appropriate box based on their filing status and age. If the taxpayer checked box 1, 3, 7, or 8, they can skip Part II and complete Part III on the back of the form. If not, they must complete Parts II and III.

Part II of the form is only completed if the taxpayer checked box 2, 4, 5, 6, or 9 in Part I. It requires the taxpayer to provide information about their permanent and total disability, including whether they filed a physician's statement for the disability in a previous year and whether they were unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity in the current tax year.

Part III of the form is used to calculate the credit amount. It provides a table with different credit amounts based on the checkboxes selected in Part I. The taxpayer must enter the appropriate credit amount on line 10. If they checked box 2, 4, 5, 6, or 9 in Part I, they must complete line 11 by adding their taxable disability income or their spouse's taxable disability income. The smaller of line 10 or line 11 is then entered on line 12. The taxpayer must also enter any pensions, annuities, or disability income received in the tax year on lines 13a, 13b, and 13c. The amount from Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11 is entered on line 14. On line 15, the taxpayer enters a different credit amount based on the checkboxes selected in Part I. The difference between line 14 and line 15 is calculated on line 16, and one-half of that amount is entered on line 17. Lines 18 and 19 are used to calculate the final credit amount, which is then multiplied by 15% on line 20. The taxpayer must also enter the tax liability limit on line 21, and the smaller of line 20 or line 21 is entered on line 22. This amount is also entered on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 6d.

Overall, Schedule R (Form 1040) is a document that helps taxpayers determine and claim the Credit for the Elderly or the Disabled on their tax return.
