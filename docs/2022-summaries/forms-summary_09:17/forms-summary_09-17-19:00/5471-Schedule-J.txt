Schedule J (Form 5471) is a form that is attached to Form 5471 and is used to report the accumulated earnings and profits (E&P) of a controlled foreign corporation (CFC). The form is divided into two parts.

Part I of Schedule J is used to report the accumulated E&P of the CFC. It includes various categories for different types of E&P balances, such as post-2017 E&P, post-1986 undistributed earnings, pre-1987 E&P, and hovering deficit and deduction for suspended taxes. The form also requires the taxpayer to report the previously taxed E&P and make adjustments for various items such as reclassified section 965 PTEP, reductions for taxes unsuspended under anti-splitter rules, and current year E&P.

Part II of Schedule J is used to report the nonpreviously taxed E&P subject to recapture as Subpart F income under section 952(c)(2). The form requires the taxpayer to report the beginning balance, additions (amounts subject to future recapture), subtractions (amounts recaptured in the current year), and the ending balance.

The form provides space for additional adjustments and requires the taxpayer to enter all amounts in the functional currency. The form also includes instructions and a reference ID number for further guidance.

Overall, Schedule J is a detailed form that helps taxpayers accurately report the accumulated earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation.
