Schedule LEP (Form 1040) is a document that taxpayers can use to request a change in their language preference for written communications from the IRS. The form should be attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, 1040-NR, 1040-PR, or 1040-SS. The form provides a list of languages, and taxpayers can select one language in which they prefer to receive written communications from the IRS. The form also informs taxpayers that they may not immediately receive communications in the requested language, as the IRS is scheduled to begin providing translations in 2023. The form can be filed with a tax return, and if e-filing, the paper version of the form should not be filed. The form should be filed with the current year tax return or any subsequent year returns, but not for any year prior to 2020. If spouses prefer different alternative languages, separate forms should be filed for each spouse. The SSN entered on the form should match the SSN listed on the tax return, and if a taxpayer doesn't have an SSN, they should apply for an ITIN. Taxpayers should select one language from the list provided on the form, and their selection will be effective for future written communications until changed or cancelled. The form also provides information about special assistance available for taxpayers with limited English proficiency, such as the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs.
