Form 1139 is an application for a tentative refund of taxes for corporations in the United States. The form is used to claim a refund for various reasons, including net operating losses, net capital losses, unused general business credits, and other reasons specified in the instructions. The form requires the corporation to provide information such as their name, employer identification number, address, and phone number. It also asks for details about the tax year of the loss or overpayment, whether a consolidated return was filed, and if an extension of time was granted for filing the return. The form also inquires about any changes in accounting period, dissolution of the corporation, and whether a petition has been filed in Tax Court. Additionally, the form asks if any part of the decrease in tax is due to a loss or credit resulting from a reportable transaction that needs to be disclosed. The form includes a computation section to calculate the decrease in tax, including taxable income, capital loss carryback, NOL deduction, and various tax credits. The form must be signed by an officer of the corporation and includes a section for a paid preparer if applicable.
