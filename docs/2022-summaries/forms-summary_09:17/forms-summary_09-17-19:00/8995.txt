The form also includes sections for calculating the total qualified business income, qualified business net loss carryforward from the prior year, total qualified business income, qualified business income component, qualified REIT dividends and publicly traded partnership (PTP) income or loss, qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP loss carryforward from the prior year, total qualified REIT dividends and PTP income, REIT and PTP component, qualified business income deduction before the income limitation, taxable income before the qualified business income deduction, net capital gain, income limitation, and the qualified business income deduction.

The taxpayer needs to enter the smaller of the calculated amount from line 10 or line 14 as the qualified business income deduction. The form also includes sections for reporting any carryforwards of qualified business losses and qualified REIT dividends and PTP losses.

The form includes instructions and directs taxpayers to visit the IRS website for further information and the latest updates.
