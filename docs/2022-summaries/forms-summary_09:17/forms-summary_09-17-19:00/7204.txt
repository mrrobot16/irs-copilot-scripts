Form 7204 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that allows taxpayers to extend the time to assess tax related to contested foreign income taxes. It is used when taxpayers want to claim a provisional foreign tax credit for contested foreign income taxes.

The form requires the taxpayer to provide their name, identifying number, and address. They must also indicate the reason for filing the form, either claiming foreign tax credit on the accrual basis or on the cash basis.

The form establishes an extended period for assessing tax, which can be suspended or affected by the operation of law. The taxpayer agrees to comply with the annual notice requirement and can file a claim for credit or refund within a specified time period.

The amount of any deficiency assessment covered by the consent is limited to the amount of federal income tax due relating to the determination that the contested foreign income tax was not a compulsory payment. The form also requires the taxpayer to provide information about the contest, including the description of the contest, the contested foreign income tax, the payor's name and identification number, the reference ID number for the contested foreign income tax, the country or U.S. territory to which the contested foreign income tax was paid, and the amount of contested foreign income tax remitted in local currency and the date(s) of remittance(s).

The form must be signed by the consenting taxpayer and their spouse (if applicable), as well as their representative or corporate officer.
