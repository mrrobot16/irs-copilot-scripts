Form 926 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for U.S. taxpayers who transfer property to a foreign corporation. The form is used to report information about the transfer and must be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for the year of the transfer or distribution.

The form is divided into several parts. Part I requires the U.S. transferor to provide their information, including their name and identifying number. It also asks questions about the transferor's status as a corporation, their existence after the transfer, their affiliation with a consolidated group, and any basis adjustments made under section 367(a)(4).

Part II requires information about the transferee foreign corporation, including its name, identifying number, address, country of incorporation or organization, and foreign law characterization. It also asks whether the transferee is a controlled foreign corporation.

Part III is for providing information about the transfer of property. It asks for details about the type of property transferred, the date of transfer, description of the property, fair market value on the date of transfer, cost or other basis, and gain recognized on the transfer. It also includes specific sections for cash, other property, property with built-in loss, and intangible property subject to section 367(d).

Part IV is for additional information regarding the transfer of property, including the transferor's interest in the transferee foreign corporation before and after the transfer, the type of nonrecognition transaction, and whether the transfer is subject to certain provisions such as gain recognition under section 904(f)(3) or recapture under section 1503(d).

The form also includes supplemental information and instructions for completing each part.

Overall, Form 926 is used to report information about the transfer of property to a foreign corporation and must be filed with the taxpayer's income tax return.
