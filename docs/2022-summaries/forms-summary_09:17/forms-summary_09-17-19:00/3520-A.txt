Form 3520-A is an annual information return that must be filed by foreign trusts with a U.S. owner. The form is used to report general information about the foreign trust, such as its name, address, and creation date. It also asks whether the foreign trust has appointed a U.S. agent to provide the IRS with relevant trust information.

The form requires the attachment of various trust documents, including a summary of agreements and understandings relating to the trust, the trust instrument, memoranda or letters of wishes, subsequent variances to original trust documents, and an organizational chart. If a U.S. agent is not appointed, the trust must attach copies of all trust documents.

The form also includes a section for reporting the foreign trust's income and expenses, as well as a balance sheet for the beginning and end of the tax year. Additionally, there are separate statements for foreign grantor trust owners and beneficiaries to report their respective information.

The form must be signed under penalties of perjury by the trustee or U.S. owner, declaring that the information provided is true, correct, and complete.
