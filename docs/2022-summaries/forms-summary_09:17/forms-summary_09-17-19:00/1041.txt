Form 1041 is the U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts. It is used to report the income, deductions, and tax liability of estates and trusts. The form is divided into several sections, including information about the estate or trust, income, deductions, and tax computation and payments.

The form begins with basic information such as the name of the estate or trust, the name and title of the fiduciary, and the address. There are checkboxes to indicate the type of estate or trust, such as decedent's estate, simple trust, complex trust, qualified disability trust, ESBT (S portion only), grantor type trust, bankruptcy estate, or pooled income fund.

The form also asks for the number of Schedules K-1 attached, the employer identification number (EIN), and the date the entity was created. There are boxes to check for nonexempt charitable and split-interest trusts, and a section to indicate if the estate or filing trust made a section 645 election.

The income section of the form includes lines to report various types of income, such as interest income, dividends, business income or loss, capital gain or loss, rents and royalties, farm income or loss, ordinary gain or loss, and other income. Deductions can be claimed for interest, taxes, fiduciary fees, charitable deductions, attorney and accountant fees, and other deductions.

The form also includes schedules for the charitable deduction, income distribution deduction, and tax computation and payments. These schedules provide additional details and calculations related to these specific areas.

The form concludes with a section for other information, such as whether the estate or trust received tax-exempt income, had an interest in a foreign financial account, received distributions from a foreign trust, or made certain elections or agreements.

The taxpayer must sign the form under penalties of perjury, declaring that the information provided is true, correct, and complete. There is also a section for the preparer to sign if applicable.

Overall, Form 1041 is a comprehensive document that estates and trusts use to report their income, deductions, and tax liability to the IRS.
