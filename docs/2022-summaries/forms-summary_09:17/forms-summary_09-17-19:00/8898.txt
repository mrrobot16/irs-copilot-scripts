Form 8898 is a statement for individuals who begin or end their bona fide residence in a U.S. possession. It is used to notify the IRS of the change in residence status. The form requires the individual to provide their personal information, including their name, social security number, and addresses before and after the change in residence. 

The form is divided into several parts. Part I requires the individual to indicate whether they became or ceased to be a bona fide resident of a U.S. possession and provide the tax year in question. They must also specify which U.S. possession they became or ceased to be a resident of. 

Part II asks for information about the individual's presence in the United States or possession. This includes the date they moved to establish bona fide residence and the number of days they were present in the United States during the tax year. 

Part III focuses on the individual's closer connection to the United States, a foreign country, or the possession. It asks about their tax home location, their principal permanent home, the location of their immediate family, and the location of their personal belongings and financial documents. 

Part IV inquires about the source of the individual's income, including whether they had an office in the possession where they conducted a trade or business, received compensation for personal services, manufactured an article for sale, or sold appreciated property. 

The form concludes with a declaration that the information provided is true, correct, and complete. The individual must sign and date the form before mailing it to the Internal Revenue Service in Austin, Texas.
