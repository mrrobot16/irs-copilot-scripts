Schedule H (Form 1120-F) is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for corporations to report deductions allocated to effectively connected income (ECI) under Regulations Section 1.861-8. The form is to be attached to Form 1120-F, which is the U.S. Income Tax Return of a Foreign Corporation.

The form is divided into four parts:

Part I: Home Office Deductible Expenses Definitely Related Solely to ECI or Non-ECI
- This section requires the corporation to enter the total expenses on the books of the home office and indicate the accounting convention used to compute the amount.
- It also includes adjustments for U.S. tax principles and calculates the total deductible expenses on the books of the home office, including interest expense and bad debt expense.

Part II: Home Office Deductible Expenses Allocated and Apportioned to ECI
- This section involves the allocation and apportionment of remaining deductible expenses on the books of the home office that are not definitely related solely to ECI or non-ECI.
- It requires the corporation to enter the average exchange rate used to convert amounts to U.S. dollars and calculate the remaining home office deductible expenses allocated and apportioned to ECI.

Part III: Allocation and Apportionment Methods and Financial Records Used to Complete Parts I and II
- This part asks the corporation to indicate whether it used any financial and other records to identify deductible expenses allocated and apportioned to ECI.
- It also includes questions about the corporation's use of ratio-based methods and other methods in Parts I and II.

Part IV: Allocation and Apportionment of Expenses on Books and Records Used to Prepare Form 1120-F, Schedule L
- This section involves the allocation and apportionment of deductible expenses on the books and records used to prepare Form 1120-F, Schedule L.
- It includes adjustments for U.S. tax principles and calculates the total deductible expenses, including third-party interest expense, interbranch interest expense, bad debt expense, and other deductible expenses not allocated or apportioned to ECI and non-ECI.

The form also includes a reconciliation of the allocation and apportionment of deductible expenses to ECI and non-ECI, as well as a calculation of the total deductible expenses on books and records allocated and apportioned to ECI and non-ECI.

Overall, Schedule H (Form 1120-F) provides a structured format for foreign corporations to report and allocate their deductible expenses in relation to effectively connected income and non-effectively connected income.
