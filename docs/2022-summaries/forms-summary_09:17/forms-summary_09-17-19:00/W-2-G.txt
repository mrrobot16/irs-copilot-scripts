The document is a Form W-2G, which is used to report certain gambling winnings to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The form contains multiple copies, each intended for a different recipient or purpose.

Copy A is to be filed with the IRS, along with Form 1096, by the payer. It includes information such as the payer's name, address, and federal identification number, as well as the winner's name, address, and taxpayer identification number. It also includes details about the reportable winnings, date won, type of wager, federal income tax withheld, and other relevant information.

Copy 1 is for the state, city, or local tax department. It contains the same information as Copy A but is intended for reporting purposes at the state or local level.

Copy B is to be attached to the winner's federal tax return if federal income tax was withheld on the winnings. It serves as proof of the withholding and includes the same information as the other copies.

Copy C is for the winner's records. It contains the same information as the other copies and serves as an important tax document.

Copy 2 is to be attached to the winner's state, city, or local income tax return, if required by the applicable taxing authority.

Copy D is for the payer's records and includes the same information as the other copies.

The form also includes instructions for the winner and the payer, providing guidance on reporting the winnings and withholding requirements. It also provides contact information for assistance and references to additional publications for more information.
