Form 8615 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the purpose of calculating the tax for certain children who have unearned income. It is to be attached to the child's Form 1040 or 1040-NR. The form includes various sections and lines for entering relevant information such as the child's net unearned income, taxable income, and the parent's taxable income. The form also provides instructions on how to complete each section. The completed form helps determine the child's tax liability based on the parent's tax rate and the child's filing status.
