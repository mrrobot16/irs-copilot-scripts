Form 1045 is an Application for Tentative Refund for individuals, estates, or trusts. It is used to carry back a net operating loss (NOL), unused general business credit, or net section 1256 contracts loss to a previous tax year. The form requires the taxpayer to provide their name, social security or employer identification number, address, and other relevant information. It also includes schedules for calculating the decrease in tax and NOL carryovers. The form must be filed separately from the tax return and can be found on the IRS website along with instructions.
