Form 1099-Q is a tax form used to report payments from qualified education programs under sections 529 and 530 of the Internal Revenue Code. The form is divided into three copies: Copy A for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Copy B for the recipient, and Copy C for the payer. The form includes information such as the payer/trustee's name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN), as well as the recipient's name, address, and TIN. It also includes details about the distribution, such as the gross distribution amount, earnings, basis, and whether there was a trustee-to-trustee transfer. The form also includes checkboxes to indicate if the distribution is from a qualified tuition program or a Coverdell ESA, and whether the recipient is the designated beneficiary. The form provides important tax information to the IRS and warns recipients that they may face penalties if the income is taxable and not reported. The instructions for recipients explain that distributions from CESAs and QTPs may be taxable and provide guidance on how to determine the taxability of the distribution. The instructions for payers/trustees provide guidance on how to complete the form and where to find additional resources for assistance.
