Form T (Timber) is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers who engage in timber-related activities. The form is used to report information about the acquisition, depletion, profit or loss from land and timber sales, and land ownership related to timber activities.

The form is divided into several parts. Part I requires the taxpayer to provide information about the acquisitions of timber properties, including the name and location of the property, the seller or person from whom the property was acquired, and the amount paid for the property.

Part II focuses on timber depletion and requires the taxpayer to provide information about the estimated quantity of timber and its cost or other basis returnable through depletion. It also includes sections for adjustments to the quantity of timber, timber acquired during the tax year, and additions to capital during the tax year.

Part III deals with the profit or loss from land and timber sales. It requires the taxpayer to provide information about the purchasers of the property, the amount received from the sale, and the cost or other basis of the property. It also includes sections for direct sale expenses and calculates the profit or loss from the sale.

Part IV is related to reforestation and timber stand activities. It requires the taxpayer to provide information about the activities performed on the timber property, the number of acres treated, and the total expenditures.

Part V focuses on land ownership and requires the taxpayer to show all changes in land accounts, including acquisitions, sales, and other changes. The taxpayer needs to provide the balance at the beginning and end of the year, as well as any appreciation included in the cost or other basis.

Overall, Form T (Timber) is a comprehensive document that taxpayers engaged in timber-related activities need to complete in order to report their timber-related transactions and activities to the IRS.
