Schedule M-3 is a form used by S corporations in the United States with total assets of $10 million or more to reconcile their net income (loss) per their income statement with their total income (loss) per their tax return. The form is divided into three parts.

Part I requires the corporation to provide financial information and reconcile its net income (loss) per its income statement. The corporation must indicate whether it prepared a certified audited non-tax-basis income statement and provide the period covered by the income statement. If the income statement has been restated, the corporation must provide an explanation and the amount of each restated item. The form also includes sections for reporting net income (loss) from nonincludible foreign entities, nonincludible U.S. entities, other foreign disregarded entities, other U.S. disregarded entities, and other qualified subchapter S subsidiaries. There are also sections for adjustments to eliminate transactions between includible and nonincludible entities, reconcile the income statement period to the tax year, and make other adjustments. The net income (loss) per the corporation's income statement is calculated by combining the amounts from lines 4 through 10.

Part II is used to reconcile the net income (loss) per the corporation's income statement with the total income (loss) per its tax return. The form includes various income (loss) items, such as income (loss) from equity method foreign corporations, gross foreign dividends, subpart F, QEF, and similar income inclusions, and income (loss) from U.S. partnerships. Each income (loss) item is reported with its corresponding temporary and permanent differences, and the total income (loss) per the income statement and tax return is calculated by combining the amounts from lines 1 through 22.

Part III is used to reconcile the expense/deduction items per the corporation's income statement with the deduction per its tax return. The form includes various expense/deduction items, such as U.S. current income tax expense, equity-based compensation, meals and entertainment expenses, and depreciation. Each expense/deduction item is reported with its corresponding temporary and permanent differences, and the total expense/deduction items are calculated by combining the amounts from lines 1 through 31.

The reconciliation totals in Part II, line 26, column (a) must equal the net income (loss) per the income statement reported in Part I, line 11. Similarly, column (d) in Part II, line 26 must equal the amount reported on Form 1120-S, Schedule K, line 18. The total expense/deduction items in Part III, line 32, are also reported on Part II, line 24.

Schedule M-3 is to be attached to Form 1120-S, which is the tax return for S corporations. The form provides a detailed reconciliation of the corporation's net income (loss) per its income statement with its total income (loss) per its tax return, helping to ensure accurate reporting and compliance with IRS regulations.
