Form 8835 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim the Renewable Electricity Production Credit. The form is to be attached to the taxpayer's tax return. The form includes various lines for reporting the electricity produced at qualified facilities using different renewable energy sources such as wind, closed-loop biomass, geothermal, solar, open-loop biomass, landfill gas, trash, hydropower, and marine and hydrokinetic renewables. Each line requires the taxpayer to enter the kilowatt-hours produced and sold, as well as the corresponding rate. The form also includes calculations for adding the totals of each line and determining the phaseout adjustment, credit before reduction, specified adjustments, special adjustments, and reduction for government grants, subsidized financing, and other credits. The form provides instructions for each line and includes sections for partnerships, S corporations, cooperatives, estates, and trusts. The final result is the renewable electricity production credit that can be claimed by the taxpayer.
