Schedule A (Form 1040-NR) is a document used by taxpayers to report itemized deductions on their federal tax return. The form provides instructions and information on how to complete it. 

The form includes several sections for different types of deductions. 

- Section 1a is for reporting state and local income taxes paid. 
- Section 1b is for entering the smaller of line 1a or $10,000 ($5,000 if married filing separately). 
- Section 2 is for reporting gifts to U.S. charities. If the gift is $250 or more, additional instructions apply. 
- Section 3 is for reporting gifts other than cash or check. If the gift is $250 or more, Form 8283 must be attached if the gift is over $500. 
- Section 4 is for reporting any carryover from the prior year. 
- Section 5 is for adding the amounts from lines 2 through 4. 
- Section 6 is for reporting casualty and theft losses from a federally declared disaster (other than net qualified disaster losses). Form 4684 must be attached and the amount from line 18 of that form should be entered. 
- Section 7 is for reporting other itemized deductions not listed on the form. The taxpayer should list the type and amount of each deduction. 
- Section 8 is for adding up the amounts from lines 1b through 7 and entering the total on Form 1040-NR, line 12. 

The form also includes a reference to the IRS website for instructions and the latest information. It also provides space for the taxpayer's name, identifying number, and the attachment sequence number. 

Overall, Schedule A (Form 1040-NR) is a tool for taxpayers to report their itemized deductions and reduce their taxable income.
