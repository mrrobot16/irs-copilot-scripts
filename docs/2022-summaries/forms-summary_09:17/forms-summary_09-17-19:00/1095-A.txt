This document provides information about Form 1095-A, which is used by Health Insurance Marketplaces to report enrollments in qualified health plans in the individual market.

The document advises recipients that they received Form 1095-A because they or a family member enrolled in health insurance coverage through the Marketplace.

Recipients are also informed that if they or their family members were enrolled in a Marketplace catastrophic health plan or separate dental policy, they are not entitled to take a premium tax credit for that coverage when filing their return.
