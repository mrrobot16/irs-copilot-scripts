The reasons include discharge of indebtedness in a title 11 case, discharge of indebtedness to the extent insolvent, discharge of qualified farm indebtedness, discharge of qualified real property business indebtedness, and discharge of qualified principal residence indebtedness.

Part II of the form requires taxpayers to enter the amount excluded from gross income and provide a description of any transactions resulting in the reduction of basis under Section 1017. This section also includes options for applying the exclusion to reduce the basis of depreciable real property, reduce any net operating loss, reduce any general business credit carryover, reduce any minimum tax credit, and reduce any net capital loss.

Part III of the form is a consent section for corporations. It allows corporations to consent to the adjustment of the basis of their property under Section 1082(a)(2) and requires the corporation to provide information about the amount excluded from gross income and the tax year involved.
