Form 5329 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used to report and calculate additional taxes on qualified retirement plans, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and other tax-favored accounts. The form is attached to the taxpayer's Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form consists of several parts, each addressing a different type of additional tax. 

Part I deals with the additional tax on early distributions from qualified retirement plans or IRAs. It requires the taxpayer to report the early distributions included in their income, any exceptions to the additional tax, and calculate the amount subject to the additional tax. The taxpayer must then enter the 10% additional tax on Schedule 2 of their Form 1040.

Part II addresses the additional tax on certain distributions from education accounts and ABLE accounts. The taxpayer must report the distributions included in their income, any exceptions to the additional tax, and calculate the amount subject to the additional tax. The 10% additional tax is then entered on Schedule 2 of Form 1040.

Part III deals with the additional tax on excess contributions to traditional IRAs. The taxpayer must report any excess contributions from the previous year, their current year's traditional IRA contributions, and distributions included in their income. The excess contributions are then calculated, and a 6% additional tax is applied to the smaller of the excess contributions or the value of the traditional IRAs.

Part IV addresses the additional tax on excess contributions to Roth IRAs. Similar to Part III, the taxpayer must report any excess contributions from the previous year, their current year's Roth IRA contributions, and distributions from Roth IRAs. The excess contributions are then calculated, and a 6% additional tax is applied to the smaller of the excess contributions or the value of the Roth IRAs.

Part V deals with the additional tax on excess contributions to Coverdell education savings accounts (ESAs). The taxpayer must report any excess contributions from the previous year, their current year's contributions, and distributions from Coverdell ESAs. The excess contributions are then calculated, and a 6% additional tax is applied to the smaller of the excess contributions or the value of the Coverdell ESAs.

Part VI addresses the additional tax on excess contributions to Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs). The taxpayer must report any excess contributions from the previous year, their current year's contributions, and distributions from Archer MSAs. The excess contributions are then calculated, and a 6% additional tax is applied to the smaller of the excess contributions or the value of the Archer MSAs.

Part VII deals with the additional tax on excess contributions to health savings accounts (HSAs). The taxpayer must report any excess contributions from the previous year, contributions made on their behalf, or contributions made by their employer. They must also report distributions from HSAs. The excess contributions are then calculated, and a 6% additional tax is applied to the smaller of the excess contributions or the value of the HSAs.

Part VIII addresses the additional tax on excess contributions to ABLE accounts. The taxpayer must report any excess contributions made to their ABLE account. A 6% additional tax is then applied to the excess contributions.

Part IX deals with the additional tax on excess accumulation in qualified retirement plans, including IRAs. The taxpayer must report the minimum required distribution for the year and the amount actually distributed to them. The difference between the two is calculated, and a 50% additional tax is applied to that amount.

The form also includes sections for the taxpayer's personal information, such as their name, social security number, and address. There is a signature section for the taxpayer to sign, and if applicable, a section for the paid preparer to sign.

It is important for taxpayers to consult the instructions provided with Form 5329 for detailed guidance on how to complete the form correctly.
