Form 8957 is a registration form for financial institutions under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in the United States. The form is used to provide information about the financial institution, including its type, legal name, country/jurisdiction of residence for tax purposes, and FATCA classification. The form also asks about the financial institution's withholding agreements with the IRS and whether it maintains branches outside of its country/jurisdiction of tax residence. The form requires the appointment of a FATCA Responsible Officer (RO) and allows for the designation of additional points of contact (POCs) for the financial institution. If the financial institution is part of an Expanded Affiliated Group, additional information about the group's members and common parent entity is required. The form must be signed by an authorized individual who certifies the accuracy and completeness of the information provided. The completed form should be mailed to the specified address in Austin, Texas. The IRS recommends using the online version of the form for faster processing.
