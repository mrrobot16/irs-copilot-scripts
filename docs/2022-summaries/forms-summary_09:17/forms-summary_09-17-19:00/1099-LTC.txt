Form 1099-LTC is a tax form used to report long-term care and accelerated death benefits. It is provided by a payer, such as an insurance company or viatical settlement provider, to the policyholder and the insured. The form includes information such as the payer's name and contact information, the policyholder's and insured's taxpayer identification numbers, the gross benefits paid under a long-term care insurance contract, the gross accelerated death benefits paid, and whether the payments were made on a per diem basis or as reimbursement of actual long-term care expenses. The form also includes optional fields to indicate if the benefits were from a qualified long-term care insurance contract and if the insured was certified as chronically or terminally ill. Different copies of the form are provided to the IRS, the policyholder, the insured, and the payer for reporting and record-keeping purposes. The instructions for completing and filing the form are available on the IRS website.
