Schedule OI (Form 1040-NR) is a document that taxpayers must attach to their Form 1040-NR when filing their taxes with the IRS. It is used to provide additional information related to the taxpayer's citizenship, residency, immigration status, presence in the United States, previous tax filings, trust ownership, compensation, income exempt from tax, and elections regarding income from real property located in the United States.

The form includes various questions that the taxpayer must answer, such as their citizenship or nationality during the tax year, their claimed residence for tax purposes, whether they have applied to be a green card holder, and whether they have ever been a U.S. citizen or green card holder.

The form also asks about the taxpayer's visa type or U.S. immigration status, any changes in visa type or immigration status, and the dates of entry and departure from the United States during the tax year.

The taxpayer is required to provide the number of days they were present in the United States during specific years, whether they have filed a U.S. income tax return in prior years, and if they are filing a return for a trust and if the trust had any U.S. or foreign owner, made distributions or loans to a U.S. person, or received contributions from a U.S. person.

The form also asks whether the taxpayer received total compensation of $250,000 or more during the tax year and if they used an alternative method to determine the source of this compensation.

If the taxpayer is claiming income tax exemption under a U.S. income tax treaty with a foreign country, they must provide the name of the country, the applicable tax treaty article, the number of months they claimed the treaty benefit in prior years, and the amount of exempt income in the current tax year.

The form also inquires whether the taxpayer was subject to tax in a foreign country on the exempt income and if they are claiming treaty benefits pursuant to a Competent Authority determination.

Lastly, the taxpayer is asked to check a box if it is their first year making an election to treat income from real property located in the United States as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business under section 871(d), or if they have made such an election in a previous year that has not been revoked.

Taxpayers should consult the instructions provided with the form for further guidance on how to complete it correctly.
