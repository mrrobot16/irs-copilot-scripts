Form 941 is a quarterly federal tax return for employers in the United States. The form is used to report the number of employees who received wages, tips, or other compensation, as well as the amount of federal income tax withheld from these wages. The form also includes sections for reporting taxable social security wages, tips, and Medicare wages, as well as adjustments for fractions of cents, sick pay, and tips and group-term life insurance. The form also includes sections for reporting various tax credits and calculating the balance due or overpayment. The form must be completed in its entirety and signed by the employer. The attached Form 941-V is a payment voucher that can be used to make a payment with Form 941. The voucher includes spaces for the employer's identification number, the amount of the payment, and the tax period. The completed voucher should be detached and sent with the payment and Form 941 to the address provided in the instructions.
