Schedule D (Form 8995-A) is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers who are patrons of agricultural or horticultural cooperatives. It is used to calculate the patron reduction amount for qualified business income allocable to qualified payments received from the cooperative.

The form consists of several sections and lines for the taxpayer to fill out. The taxpayer must enter their name and taxpayer identification number at the top of the form. If they have more than three trades, businesses, or aggregations, they can attach additional Schedule D forms as needed.

Line 1a is for the taxpayer to enter the name of their trade, business, or aggregation, and line 1b is for the corresponding taxpayer identification number.

Line 2 is used to calculate the qualified business income allocable to qualified payments received from the cooperative. The instructions provide further guidance on how to determine this amount.

Line 3 instructs the taxpayer to multiply line 2 by 9% (0.09) to calculate the result.

Line 4 is for the taxpayer to enter the W-2 wages from their trade or business that are allocable to the qualified payments.

Line 5 instructs the taxpayer to multiply line 4 by 50% (0.50) to calculate the result.

Line 6 is where the taxpayer enters the smaller of line 3 or line 5. This amount is then transferred to Form 8995-A, line 14, for the corresponding trade, business, or aggregation.

The form includes a reference to the IRS website for instructions and the latest information on Form 8995-A.

The document also includes a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, which provides information on the collection and use of taxpayer information.

Overall, Schedule D (Form 8995-A) is a tool for taxpayers to calculate the patron reduction amount for qualified business income received from agricultural or horticultural cooperatives.
