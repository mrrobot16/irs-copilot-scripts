Form 1120-RIC is the U.S. Income Tax Return for Regulated Investment Companies. It is used by regulated investment companies to report their income, deductions, and tax liability to the IRS. The form requires the RIC to provide information such as the name and address of the fund, its employer identification number, total assets, and whether it is a personal holding company or in compliance with certain regulations.

The form is divided into several parts. Part I is for reporting investment company taxable income, including dividends, interest, net foreign currency gain or loss, payments with respect to securities loans, and other income. Deductions such as compensation of officers, salaries and wages, rents, taxes and licenses, and depreciation are also reported in Part I.

Part II is for reporting tax on undistributed net capital gain not designated under Section 852(b)(3)(D). This includes net capital gain from Schedule D, capital gain dividends, and the calculation of capital gains tax.

Schedules A, B, J, K, L, M-1, and M-2 are also included in the form for additional information and reconciliations.

The form requires the signature of an officer of the RIC and includes a declaration of preparer. It also provides space for attaching additional statements and schedules as needed.

Overall, Form 1120-RIC is a comprehensive tax return form specifically designed for regulated investment companies to accurately report their income and tax liability to the IRS.
