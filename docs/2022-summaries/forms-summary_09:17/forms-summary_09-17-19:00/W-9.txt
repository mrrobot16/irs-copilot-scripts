Form W-9 is a document used by individuals or entities to provide their taxpayer identification number (TIN) to requesters who are required to file information returns with the IRS. The form requests the individual or entity's name, business name (if applicable), federal tax classification, exemptions (if applicable), address, and TIN. The form also includes a certification section where the individual or entity certifies their TIN is correct, they are not subject to backup withholding, they are a U.S. citizen or U.S. person, and any applicable FATCA codes are correct. The form provides specific instructions on how to complete each section and includes information on backup withholding, FATCA reporting, updating information, penalties for non-compliance, and securing tax records from identity theft.
