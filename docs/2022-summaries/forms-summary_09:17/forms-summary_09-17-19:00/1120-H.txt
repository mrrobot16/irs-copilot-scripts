Form 1120-H is the U.S. Income Tax Return for Homeowners Associations. It is used by homeowners associations to report their income and expenses to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The form requires the association to provide basic information such as their name, address, and employer identification number. It also asks for details about the association's exempt function income, total expenditures, tax-exempt interest, and gross income from various sources such as dividends, rents, and royalties. The form also includes sections for deductions related to the production of gross income, such as salaries and wages, repairs and maintenance, and depreciation. The form calculates the association's taxable income and tax liability, and provides space for reporting tax credits, overpayments, and any amounts owed or to be refunded. The form must be signed by an authorized officer of the association and may also require the signature of a paid preparer.
