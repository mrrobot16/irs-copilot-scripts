Form 8857 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to request innocent spouse relief. Innocent spouse relief is available to taxpayers who believe that they should not be held responsible for an erroneous item or underpayment of tax from a joint tax return. The form includes instructions on how to complete it and where to find additional help. It also provides important information such as the requirement to notify the person listed on line 6 of the request for relief and the confidentiality of certain personal information. The form includes sections for taxpayers to provide their personal information, describe their current marital status, explain their involvement in preparing the joint returns, provide information about their financial situation, and disclose any domestic violence or abuse they have experienced. The form also includes a section for taxpayers to request a refund if they qualify for relief and have already paid the tax. The form must be signed under penalties of perjury and a copy should be kept for the taxpayer's records.
