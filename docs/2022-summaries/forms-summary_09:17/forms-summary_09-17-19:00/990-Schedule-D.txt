Schedule D is a supplemental financial statement form that organizations need to complete if they answered "Yes" to certain questions on Form 990, which is the annual tax return for tax-exempt organizations in the United States. The purpose of Schedule D is to provide additional information about specific financial transactions or activities of the organization.

Part I of Schedule D is for organizations that maintain donor advised funds or other similar funds or accounts. It asks for information about the number of funds/accounts, the value of contributions and grants, and whether the organization informed donors and grantees about the use of funds.

It asks for information about the purpose of the easements, the number of easements, acreage restricted, and any modifications or terminations of easements. It also asks about the organization's policy for monitoring and enforcing easements.

Part IV is for organizations that have escrow and custodial arrangements. It asks about the organization's role as an agent, trustee, or custodian for assets not included on the tax return. It also asks about any liabilities related to escrow or custodial accounts.
