Form 5695 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim residential energy credits on their tax return. The form consists of two parts: Part I for the Residential Clean Energy Credit and Part II for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit.

In Part I, taxpayers report the costs of various qualified energy properties, including solar electric property, solar water heating property, small wind energy property, geothermal heat pump property, and biomass fuel property. They calculate the total costs and multiply it by 30% to determine the credit amount. There is also a section for qualified fuel cell property, where taxpayers indicate if the property was installed in their main home and provide the address. The costs are multiplied by 30% and the kilowatt capacity is calculated to determine the credit amount.

Part II focuses on the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit. Taxpayers indicate if the qualified energy efficiency improvements or residential energy property costs were for their main home located in the United States. They provide the address and specify if any of the improvements were related to the construction of the home. The form includes a lifetime limitation and lists various qualified energy efficiency improvements, such as insulation, exterior doors, metal or asphalt roofs, and windows. Taxpayers calculate the credit amount based on these improvements and the maximum cost allowed. There is also a section for residential energy property costs, including energy-efficient building property, qualified furnaces or boilers, and advanced main air circulating fans. The total costs are added together to determine the credit amount.

The form includes spaces for credit carryforward from the previous year, limitations based on tax liability, and the final credit amount. Taxpayers are instructed to attach Form 5695 to their Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR and also report the credit amount on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 5.
