Form 8809-I is an application for an extension of time to file FATCA Form 8966, which is used to report information about foreign financial accounts. The form requires the filer to provide their name, address, taxpayer identification number, and point of contact information. If the filer is sponsored by another entity or intermediary, they must also provide information about that entity. The form also asks the filer to indicate their method of filing Form 8966 (electronic or paper) and whether they have already requested an automatic extension and now need an additional extension. If the filer needs an additional extension, they must provide a detailed explanation for why they were unable to file by the original extension deadline. The form must be signed and dated, and the filer declares under penalties of perjury that the information provided is true and complete.
