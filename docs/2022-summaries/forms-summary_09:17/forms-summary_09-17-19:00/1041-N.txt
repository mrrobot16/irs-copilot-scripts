Form 1041-N is the U.S. Income Tax Return for Electing Alaska Native Settlement Trusts. It is used by Alaska Native Settlement Trusts to report their income and calculate their tax liability. The form includes several sections for providing general information about the trust, computing the tax, and reporting other relevant information.

Part I of the form asks for general information such as the name of the trust, employer identification number, and the name and title of the trustee. It also asks for the name of the sponsoring Alaska Native Corporation and whether Form 1041 was filed in the prior year.

Part II is used to compute the tax liability of the trust. It includes sections for reporting different types of income, such as interest income, dividends, capital gains or losses, and other income. Deductions, such as taxes and fees, are also reported in this section.

Part III is for reporting other information about the trust, such as whether it received property or income from an Alaska Native Corporation, whether it had any foreign financial accounts, and whether it needs to make a section 643(e)(3) election.

The form also includes several schedules, such as Schedule D for reporting capital gains and losses, and Schedule K for reporting distributions to beneficiaries.

The form must be signed by the trustee or an officer representing the trustee, and the preparer (if applicable).
