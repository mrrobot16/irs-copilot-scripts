Form 461 is a document issued by the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used to calculate the limitation on business losses and must be attached to the taxpayer's tax return. The form includes three parts.

Part I is for reporting total income or loss items. It instructs the taxpayer to enter amounts from various lines on Schedule 1 (Form 1040) and Form 1040 or 1040-SR, which relate to income, losses, and deductions from a trade or business.

Part II is for adjusting amounts that are not attributable to a trade or business. It requires the taxpayer to enter any income or gain reported on lines 1 through 8 that is not related to a trade or business, as well as any losses or deductions reported on those lines that are also not attributable to a trade or business.

Part III is for calculating the limitation on losses. The taxpayer is instructed to enter the negative number from line 12 as a positive number if it is negative, or as a negative number if it is positive. Then, the taxpayer adds the amounts from lines 9 and 13. If the result is less than zero, the taxpayer is instructed to enter that amount as a positive number on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 8p. If the result is zero or greater, the taxpayer does not need to attach Form 461 to their tax return.

The form also provides a space for the taxpayer's name, identifying number, and the year of the tax return. The instructions and the latest information regarding the form can be found on the IRS website at www.irs.gov/Form461.
