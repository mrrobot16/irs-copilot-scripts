Form CT-1 X is a tax form used by employers to correct errors made on their Form CT-1, which is the Employers Annual Railroad Retirement Tax Return. The form is used to either adjust underreported or overreported tax amounts, or to claim a refund or abatement of overreported tax amounts. The form must be completed for each year that needs correction and all five pages of the form must be completed. The form includes sections for selecting the appropriate process, completing certifications, entering corrections for the calendar year being corrected, explaining the corrections, and signing the form. The form also provides guidance on which process to use based on the type of errors being corrected and the timing of filing the form.
