Form 945-A is an annual record of federal tax liability form issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers who are semiweekly schedule depositors or who have accumulated tax liability of $100,000 or more in any given month. The form is used to report the tax liability for each month of the calendar year. The taxpayer must enter the tax liability for each day of the month in the designated columns. The total tax liability for each month is then calculated and entered in the corresponding total column. At the end of the year, the total tax liability for the year is calculated by adding up the monthly totals. This total must match line 3 on Form 945, line 19 on Form CT-1, or line 9 on Form 944. The form includes instructions and can be filed along with Form 945, 945-X, CT-1, CT-1 X, 944, or 944-X. The form also includes an OMB number and a Paperwork Reduction Act Notice.
