Form 941-SS is the Employers Quarterly Federal Tax Return for American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is used by employers in these territories to report wages, tips, and other compensation paid to employees and calculate the social security and Medicare taxes owed. 

The form is divided into several parts. Part 1 asks for information about the number of employees and the wages paid to them for the quarter. Part 2 is used to report adjustments and credits, such as the small business payroll tax credit and the credit for qualified sick and family leave wages. Part 3 collects information about the business, such as whether it has closed or is a seasonal employer. Part 4 allows the business to designate a third-party representative to discuss the return with the IRS. Part 5 is where the form is signed by the employer.

The form also includes a payment voucher, Form 941-V(SS), which is used to make a payment with Form 941-SS. The voucher asks for the employer's identification number, the amount paid, and the tax period. It should be detached and sent with the payment and Form 941-SS to the address provided in the instructions.

Both Form 941-SS and Form 941-V(SS) include a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, which explains the purpose of the forms and the requirements for providing the requested information. It also states that tax returns and return information are generally confidential, but may be disclosed to certain parties as authorized by law. The notice also provides estimated average times for completing and filing the forms.
