Form 9465 is an Installment Agreement Request form provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers who are unable to pay their tax liability in full. The form is used to request a monthly payment plan to pay off the tax debt over time. 

The form includes several sections for the taxpayer to provide their personal information, such as name, social security number, address, and contact information. It also asks for details about the tax liability, including the amount owed and any additional balances due. 

The taxpayer is required to calculate the monthly payment amount they can afford to pay towards their tax debt. The form provides instructions on how to calculate this amount and suggests making the payment as large as possible to limit interest and penalty charges. 

There are options for making payments through direct debit from a checking account or payroll deduction, and the form includes sections for providing the necessary banking information. 

If the taxpayer defaulted on a previous installment agreement within the past 12 months, owes between $25,000 and $50,000, and the proposed monthly payment amount is less than the calculated amount, additional information is required in Part II of the form. This includes information about the taxpayer's primary residence, marital status, dependents, household expenses, income, and expenses related to health insurance, court-ordered payments, and child or dependent care. 

The form must be signed and submitted to the IRS, and the taxpayer agrees to allow the IRS to contact third parties and disclose tax information for processing the request and administering the agreement.
