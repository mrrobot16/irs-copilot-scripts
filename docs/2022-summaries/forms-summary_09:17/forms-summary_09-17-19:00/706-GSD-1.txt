The document is a notification form for reporting distributions from a generation-skipping trust. It is used by a trustee to report to the distributee and the IRS the details of each distribution made from the trust. The form includes information such as the trust's employer identification number, the distributee's identifying number, the date of distribution, description of the property distributed, value of the distribution, and inclusion ratio. The form also includes a declaration of the preparer and a section for the trustee's signature. The distributee is instructed to file Form 706-GS(D), Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Return for Distributions, to report the distribution to the IRS. The form provides specific instructions on how to complete each section and reminds the distributee to attach a copy of each Form 706-GS(D-1) received during the year to their own Form 706-GS(D). If there are any errors on the form, the distributee is advised to notify the trustee and request a corrected form.
