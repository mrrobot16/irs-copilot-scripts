The organization provides the name, address, and EIN of each related organization, as well as its primary activity, legal domicile, exempt Code section, public charity status (if applicable), and direct controlling entity. The organization also indicates whether each related organization is a Section 512(b)(13) controlled entity.

The organization provides the name, address, and EIN of each related organization treated as a partnership, as well as its primary activity, legal domicile, direct controlling entity, predominant income (related, unrelated, excluded from tax), share of total income, share of end-of-year assets, whether there are disproportionate allocations, the Code VUBI amount in box 20 of Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), and whether the organization is a general or managing partner.
