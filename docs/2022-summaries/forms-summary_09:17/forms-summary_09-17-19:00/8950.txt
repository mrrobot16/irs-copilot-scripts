Form 8950 is an application form used for the Voluntary Correction Program (VCP) under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS) of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It is filed electronically only on Pay.gov. The form requires the plan sponsor's information, including name, address, contact person, and employer identification number. It also asks for details about the plan, such as the plan type, plan number, plan year end, plan assets, and number of participants. The form includes questions about the type of VCP submission, whether there is a retroactive plan amendment, if the plan or plan sponsor has been involved in an abusive tax avoidance transaction, and if the VCP submission relates to the diversion or misuse of plan assets. The form also includes a Procedural Requirements Checklist that helps ensure a complete submission. The form must be signed and dated by an authorized employee or the owner of the plan sponsor.
