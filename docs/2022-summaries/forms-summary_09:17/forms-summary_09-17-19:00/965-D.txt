Form 965-D is a document used for transferring tax liabilities under Section 965(i)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. The form requires information about the transferor and transferee, including their names, taxpayer identification numbers, and addresses. It also asks for identifying information about the S Corporation involved in the transfer and details about the triggering event that led to the transfer agreement.

The form includes sections for reporting the unpaid section 965(i) net tax liability being assumed by the transferee and determining the transferee's ability to pay the remaining liability. It also includes a provision for the transferee to agree to assume the liability of the transferor and comply with all applicable requirements of Section 965(i) and related regulations. The transferor and any successor to the transferor remain jointly and severally liable for the transferred tax liability.

The form must be signed by both the transferor and transferee, under penalties of perjury, and include their contact information. The IRS may reject the transfer agreement if it contains material misrepresentations or omissions or if the transferee fails to provide requested additional information.
