Form W-8BEN is a certificate of foreign status of beneficial owner for United States tax withholding and reporting. It is used by individuals to declare their foreign status to withholding agents or payers in order to claim tax treaty benefits or to certify that they are not subject to certain U.S. taxes. This form should not be sent to the IRS, but rather given to the withholding agent or payer. The form includes sections for the individual's identification, including name, country of citizenship, permanent residence address, and mailing address if different. It also asks for the individual's U.S. taxpayer identification number, foreign tax identifying number, reference numbers, and date of birth. Part II of the form allows the individual to claim tax treaty benefits if applicable. Part III is a certification section where the individual declares under penalties of perjury that the information provided is true, correct, and complete. The form also includes a signature section and a space for the date and printed name of the signer.
