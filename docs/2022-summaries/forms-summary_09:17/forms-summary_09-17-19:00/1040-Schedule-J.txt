Schedule J (Form 1040) is a tax form used by farmers and fishermen in the United States to calculate their income averaging. It is an attachment to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form consists of several lines where taxpayers are required to enter specific information. Here is a summary of the key sections:

- Line 1: Taxpayers enter their taxable income from their 2022 Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 15.
- Line 2a: Taxpayers enter their elected farm income, which should not exceed the amount on line 1. Any capital gains related to farming are also entered on this line.
- Line 3: The difference between line 1 and line 2a is calculated and entered on this line.
- Line 4: Tax on the amount from line 3 is calculated using the 2022 tax rates.
- Line 5: If taxpayers used Schedule J to calculate their tax for a previous year, they enter the relevant amount from that year's Schedule J on this line. Otherwise, they enter their taxable income from the previous year's tax return.
- Line 6: The amount from line 2a is divided by 3.0 and entered on this line.
- Line 7: Lines 5 and 6 are combined, and if the result is zero or less, taxpayers enter -0-.
- Line 8: Tax on the amount from line 7 is calculated using the 2019 tax rates.
- Line 9: Similar to line 5, taxpayers enter the relevant amount from a previous year's Schedule J or their taxable income from the previous year's tax return.
- Line 10: The amount from line 6 is entered on this line.
- Line 11: Lines 9 and 10 are combined, and if the result is less than zero, taxpayers enter it as a negative amount.
- Line 12: Tax on the amount from line 11 is calculated using the 2020 tax rates.
- Line 13: Similar to line 5, taxpayers enter the relevant amount from a previous year's Schedule J or their taxable income from the previous year's tax return.
- Line 14: The amount from line 6 is entered on this line.
- Line 15: Lines 13 and 14 are combined, and if the result is less than zero, taxpayers enter it as a negative amount.
- Line 16: Tax on the amount from line 15 is calculated using the 2021 tax rates.
- Line 17: The tax amounts from lines 4, 8, 12, and 16 are added together.
- Line 18: The amount from line 17 is entered on this line.
- Line 19: Similar to line 5, taxpayers enter the relevant amount from a previous year's Schedule J or their tax from the previous year's tax return.
- Line 20: Similar to line 5, taxpayers enter the relevant amount from a previous year's Schedule J or their tax from the previous year's tax return.
- Line 21: Similar to line 5, taxpayers enter the relevant amount from a previous year's Schedule J or their tax from the previous year's tax return.
- Line 22: The tax amounts from lines 19 through 21 are added together.
- Line 23: The tax amount from line 22 is subtracted from the amount on line 18. The resulting tax amount is also entered on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 16.

Taxpayers are advised to use caution and consider other tax calculation methods, such as the Tax Table, Tax Computation Worksheet, Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet, or Schedule D Tax Worksheet, as their tax may be lower when using these methods. Schedule J should only be attached if it is being used to calculate the tax.
