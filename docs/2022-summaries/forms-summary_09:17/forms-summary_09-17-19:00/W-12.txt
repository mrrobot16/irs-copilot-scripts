Form W-12 is an application for a Paid Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The form is used by tax professionals to apply for a new PTIN or renew an existing one. The form requires the applicant to provide their personal information, including their name, PTIN, year of application/renewal, Social Security Number (SSN), date of birth, mailing address, phone number, and email address. The applicant must also indicate if they have been convicted of a felony in the past 10 years and provide an explanation if applicable. If renewing their PTIN, the applicant must provide the address used on their last U.S. individual income tax return filed and their filing status and tax year on that return. They must also confirm their federal tax compliance and acknowledge their data security responsibilities as a paid tax return preparer. The form allows applicants to indicate their professional credentials, such as being an attorney, Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Enrolled Agent (EA), or Enrolled Retirement Plan Agent (ERPA), and provide the necessary information for each credential. The form also includes a fee schedule for the PTIN application processing fee, which is nonrefundable. The completed form can be submitted online or by mail to the IRS Tax Professional PTIN Processing Center in San Antonio, TX. The processing time for PTIN applications is typically 4 to 6 weeks.
