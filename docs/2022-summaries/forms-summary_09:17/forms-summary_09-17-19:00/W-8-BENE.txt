This form is to be used by entities, and individuals should use Form W-8BEN instead. The form includes various sections for identifying the beneficial owner, indicating the entity type, and determining the entity's status under different tax regulations. The form also includes sections for claiming tax treaty benefits, certifying certain statuses such as sponsored FFI or exempt retirement plans, and providing information about substantial U.S. owners of passive NFFEs. The form must be signed by an authorized individual and can be provided to withholding agents or payers, but should not be sent to the IRS. The form is accompanied by detailed instructions available on the IRS website.
