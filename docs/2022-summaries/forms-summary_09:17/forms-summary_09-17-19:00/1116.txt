Form 1116 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States for individuals, estates, or trusts to claim a foreign tax credit. The form is used to report and calculate the amount of foreign taxes paid or accrued, and to determine the credit amount that can be claimed.

The form must be attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, 1040-NR, 1041, or 990-T. It consists of several parts and sections:

Part I: Taxable Income or Loss From Sources Outside the United States
- This section requires the taxpayer to report their foreign country or U.S. possession, gross income from sources within that country, deductions and losses related to that income, and the calculation of net foreign source taxable income.

Part II: Foreign Taxes Paid or Accrued
- This section requires the taxpayer to report the foreign taxes paid or accrued in foreign currency and in U.S. dollars. It also includes specific categories for taxes withheld at source on dividends, rents and royalties, interest, and other foreign taxes.

Part III: Figuring the Credit
- This section involves calculations to determine the total foreign taxes paid or accrued, any carryover or carrybacks of foreign taxes, reductions in foreign taxes, and taxes reclassified under high tax kickout.

Part IV: Summary of Credits From Separate Parts III
- This section summarizes the credits for different categories of income, such as section 951A category income, foreign branch category income, passive category income, general category income, section 901(j) income, certain income re-sourced by treaty, and lump-sum distributions.

The form also includes instructions and references to additional resources on the IRS website for more guidance. It is important to note that each category of income requires a separate Form 1116, and if taxes were paid to multiple foreign countries or U.S. possessions, separate columns and lines should be used for each.
