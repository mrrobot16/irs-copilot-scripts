Schedule G-1 (Form 5471) is a document that taxpayers need to attach to Form 5471 when filing their taxes. It is used to report information about a Cost Sharing Arrangement (CSA) in which a foreign corporation was a participant during the tax year. 

The form asks for the following information:

1. A brief description of the CSA.
2. Whether the foreign corporation became a participant in the CSA during the tax year.
3. Whether the CSA was in effect before January 5, 2009.
4. The foreign corporation's share of reasonably anticipated benefits for the CSA during the tax year.
5. Whether a U.S. taxpayer made any platform contributions to the CSA during the tax year, and if so, the present value of those contributions.
6. The total amount of stock-based compensation deductions claimed by the filer for the tax year, and the total amount of deductions for stock-based compensation granted during the term of the CSA that is directly identified with or reasonably allocable to the intangible development activity.
7. The total amount of intangible development costs for the CSA, and the amount of those costs allocable to the foreign corporation based on its share of reasonably anticipated benefits.

The form must be completed for each CSA in which the foreign corporation participated during the tax year, and all amounts should be reported in U.S. dollars.

Taxpayers can find instructions and the latest information about the form on the IRS website.
