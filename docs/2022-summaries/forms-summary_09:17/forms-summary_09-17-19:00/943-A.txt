Form 943-A is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for agricultural employers to record their federal tax liability. The form is used by semiweekly schedule depositors or those who have accumulated tax liabilities of $100,000 or more in any given month. 

The form is divided into twelve sections, one for each month of the year. Within each section, there are spaces to record the daily tax liabilities for each day of the month. The form also includes a space to calculate the total liability for each month and the total tax liability for the entire year.

It is important to note that this form should only reflect the tax liability and not the deposits made. The IRS receives deposit data through electronic funds transfers, so adjustments reported on any Forms 943-X should not be included in the current year tax liability.

The form includes instructions and a link to the IRS website for additional information. It also includes a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice.

Overall, Form 943-A is a tool for agricultural employers to accurately record and calculate their federal tax liability throughout the year.
