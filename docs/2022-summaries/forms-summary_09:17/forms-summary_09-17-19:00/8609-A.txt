Form 8609-A is an annual statement that is filed with a taxpayer's federal income tax return. It is used to calculate the Low-Income Housing Credit for a building that is part of a qualified low-income housing project. The form includes several lines for entering information such as the eligible basis of the building, the low-income portion, and the qualified basis of the low-income building. It also includes lines for adjustments for disposition or acquisition during the tax year, additions to qualified basis, and a Section 42(f)(3)(B) modification. The form calculates the credit for the building before any reduction, disallowed credit due to federal grants, and the credit allowed for the tax year. The taxpayer's proportionate share of the credit is also calculated, as well as any adjustments for deferred first-year credit. The final result is the taxpayer's credit, which is entered on Form 8586. The form also includes a section for compliance information and a building identification number. It is important to note that the instructions for this form should be referred to for additional guidance.
