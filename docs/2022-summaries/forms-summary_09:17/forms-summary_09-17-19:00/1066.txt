Form 1066 is the U.S. Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (REMIC) Income Tax Return for the year 2022. It is used to report the taxable income or net loss of a REMIC to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The form includes several sections for reporting income, deductions, tax computation, and additional information. 

Section I requires the computation of taxable income or net loss, including income from interest, accrued market discount, ordinary gain or loss, and other income. Deductions such as salaries and wages, rent, interest, taxes, depreciation, and other expenses are also reported in this section. The taxable income or net loss is calculated by subtracting the total deductions from the total income.

Section II is used to calculate the tax and payments made by the REMIC. The total tax is determined by adding the tax on net income from prohibited transactions, tax on net income from foreclosure property, and tax on contributions after the startup day. The tax paid with Form 7004 is also reported in this section.

Additional information is provided in Section III, including the type of entity the REMIC is, the number of residual interest holders, and whether the REMIC had a financial interest in foreign financial accounts or received distributions from a foreign trust.

The balance sheets per books are reported in Schedule L, showing the assets, liabilities, and capital of the REMIC at the beginning and end of the year. Schedule M is used to reconcile the capital accounts of the residual interest holders.

Finally, there is a section for designating the partnership representative for the REMIC.

The form must be signed by the taxpayer under penalties of perjury and includes a declaration of the preparer, if applicable.
