Form 7207 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for claiming the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit. The form requires the taxpayer to provide information about the components they produced in the United States and sold in their trade or business during the tax year to unrelated persons.

The form includes various sections for different types of components, such as solar energy components, wind energy components, torque tube and structural fastener components, inverter components, electrode active materials, battery components, and critical minerals. For each component, the taxpayer needs to provide details such as the eligible component, unit of measurement, credit per unit, number of units produced and sold or sales price/costs, and the amount of credit (calculated by multiplying the credit per unit by the number of units or sales price/costs).

The form also includes a section for reporting the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit from other entities, such as partnerships, S corporations, estates, and trusts. The taxpayer needs to add up the amounts from all the lines and report the total on Form 3800, Part III, line 1b.

Overall, Form 7207 is used to claim the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit for eligible components produced and sold by the taxpayer during the tax year.
