Form W-8IMY is a certificate that is used by foreign intermediaries, foreign flow-through entities, or certain U.S. branches to claim their status for U.S. tax withholding and reporting purposes. The form is not to be sent to the IRS but should be provided to the withholding agent or payer. The form provides various checkboxes for the entity to indicate its specific status, such as a qualified intermediary, nonqualified intermediary, withholding foreign partnership, withholding foreign trust, nonwithholding foreign partnership, nonwithholding foreign simple trust, nonwithholding foreign grantor trust, and more. The form also includes sections for identifying the entity, providing its permanent and mailing addresses, taxpayer identification number, and other relevant information. The form must be signed by an authorized official and includes a certification under penalties of perjury.
