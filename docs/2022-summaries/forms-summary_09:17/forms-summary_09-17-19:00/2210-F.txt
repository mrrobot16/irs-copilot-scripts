Form 2210-F is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers who are farmers or fishermen and have underpaid their estimated taxes. This form is to be attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, 1040-NR, or 1041. 

The form provides instructions and information on when to file and when not to file Form 2210-F. Generally, taxpayers do not need to file this form as the IRS will calculate any penalty owed and send a bill accordingly. However, taxpayers may still use Form 2210-F to calculate their penalty if they choose to do so.

The form is divided into three parts. Part I includes reasons for filing, such as requesting a waiver or filing a joint return for only one of the two years. If none of the reasons apply, taxpayers are advised not to file Form 2210-F.

Part II involves calculating the underpayment. Taxpayers are required to enter their tax after credits, other taxes, refundable credits, and the current year tax. They then subtract the withholding taxes from the current year tax to determine if a penalty is owed.

Part III is used to calculate the penalty. Taxpayers enter the date the underpayment was paid or April 15, 2023, whichever is earlier. They also calculate the number of days from January 15, 2023, to the payment date. The penalty is calculated by multiplying the underpayment by the number of days and dividing it by 365. The resulting penalty amount is then entered on the appropriate line of the tax return.

Overall, Form 2210-F is a tool for farmers and fishermen to calculate and report any penalties for underpayment of estimated taxes.
