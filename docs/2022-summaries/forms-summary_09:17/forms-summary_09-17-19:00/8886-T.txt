Form 8886-T is a disclosure form required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax-exempt entities in the United States to report prohibited tax shelter transactions. The form is used to provide information about the tax-exempt entity, including its name, employer identification number, and address. 

The form also requires the tax-exempt entity to indicate its type, such as an organization described in section 501(c) or 501(d), a state or political subdivision, an Indian tribal government, or various types of retirement or savings plans.

The form asks the tax-exempt entity to identify the type of prohibited tax shelter transaction involved, such as a listed transaction, a confidential transaction, or a transaction with contractual protection. If the transaction is a listed transaction or substantially similar to a listed transaction, the form requires the tax-exempt entity to identify the specific listed transactions.

Additionally, the form asks for the identity of other parties involved in the transaction, whether taxable or tax-exempt, if known. The tax-exempt entity must sign the form, declaring under penalty of perjury that they are authorized to sign the disclosure and that the information provided is true, correct, and complete.

The form includes a separate instruction sheet and a notice regarding the Paperwork Reduction Act. The latest version of the form is dated December 2019.
