Form 8918 is a Material Advisor Disclosure Statement form provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax purposes. The form is used by material advisors to disclose information about reportable transactions and provide details about the tax benefits generated by these transactions.

The form requires the material advisor to provide their name, identifying number, address, and contact information. It also asks for information about the reportable transaction, such as the name of the transaction, the type of transaction, and the published guidance number if applicable.

The material advisor is also required to provide information about their role in the transaction and any other entities or individuals who provided material aid, assistance, or advice. The form asks if related entities, foreign entities, or tax-exempt entities are needed to obtain the intended tax benefits and requires a description of their role.

Additionally, the form asks about the types of financial instruments used in the transaction and the estimated tax benefits expected to be claimed by the taxpayer. The material advisor must also indicate the timing of the tax benefits and provide the Internal Revenue Code section(s) used to claim these benefits.

Finally, the material advisor is asked to describe the reportable transaction in detail, including the expected tax treatment, tax benefits generated, and the role of entities, individuals, and financial instruments involved. The form must be signed by the material advisor under penalties of perjury.

The form includes instructions for completing each section and provides a separate Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice.
