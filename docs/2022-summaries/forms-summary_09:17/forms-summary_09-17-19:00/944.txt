Form 944 is an annual federal tax return for employers in the United States. This form is filed instead of quarterly Forms 941 if the IRS has notified the employer in writing. The form requires the employer to provide their employer identification number (EIN), name, trade name (if any), address, and other contact information. 

The form is divided into several parts. Part 1 asks employers to answer questions about wages, tips, and other compensation, federal income tax withheld, and social security and Medicare wages and tips. Part 2 is for reporting adjustments and credits, including the small business payroll tax credit and credits for qualified sick and family leave wages. Part 3 is for providing information about the business, such as if it has closed or stopped paying wages. Part 4 allows employers to designate a third-party designee to discuss the return with the IRS. Part 5 is for the employer's signature and declaration of accuracy.

The form includes a payment voucher, Form 944-V, which can be used to make a payment with the Form 944. The voucher requires the employer to enter their EIN, the amount of the payment, and their business name and address. The voucher should be detached and sent with the payment and Form 944 to the address provided in the instructions.

The form also includes a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, which explains the purpose of the form and the requirements for providing information. It also provides estimated average times for completing and filing the form, and information about the confidentiality of tax return information.

Overall, Form 944 is a comprehensive tax return for employers to report their annual tax information to the IRS.
