Form 8883 is an Asset Allocation Statement that must be attached to an individual's income tax return. It is used when a transaction is made under Section 338 of the Internal Revenue Code. The form collects identifying information for the filer, the other party involved in the transaction, and the target corporation. It also asks for general information such as the acquisition date, percentage of target corporation stock purchased, stock price, acquisition costs, and target liabilities. The form also includes questions regarding the filer's affiliation with a group of corporations, the target corporation's affiliation, and whether the target corporation or any target affiliate meets certain criteria such as being a controlled foreign corporation or a passive foreign investment company. The form also includes sections for reporting the original statement of assets transferred and a supplemental statement if there have been any changes in the allocation of assets.
