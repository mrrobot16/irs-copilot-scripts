Form 1040-C is a tax form used by departing aliens in the United States to report their income and tax liabilities before leaving the country. The form is not a final income tax return, and a final return must be filed after the tax year ends.

The form requires the individual to provide personal information such as their name, social security number, and address. They must also provide details about their arrival and departure dates, as well as their passport or alien registration card number.

The form includes several sections for the individual to indicate their tax status as a resident or nonresident alien, and whether their income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. They must also provide information about their visa status and whether they have a permit to reenter the United States.

The form asks about any waivers of rights or privileges, as well as whether the individual has furnished Form W-9 to a withholding agent. It also asks about applications for U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent resident status.

The form includes sections for reporting income, deductions, and calculating tax liability. It also asks about any current charges against the individual concerning their U.S. taxes and whether they plan to return to the United States.

The form must be signed by the individual and, if applicable, their spouse. It also includes a section for a paid preparer to sign if the individual used one.

Overall, Form 1040-C is used by departing aliens to report their income and tax liabilities before leaving the United States. It is not a final tax return and a final return must be filed after the tax year ends.
