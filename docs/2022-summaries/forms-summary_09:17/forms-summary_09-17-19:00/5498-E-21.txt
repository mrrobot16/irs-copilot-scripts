It is noted that contributions should not be deducted on the beneficiary's income tax return. The form also reminds the beneficiary to track their ESA basis and provides information about rollovers.

Instructions are also provided for the trustee or issuer on how to complete the form. The due dates for furnishing the form to the beneficiary and filing with the IRS are specified. Contact information is provided for assistance with reporting on Form 5498-ESA.

Overall, Form 5498-ESA is used to report contributions and rollover contributions made to a Coverdell ESA and provides instructions for both beneficiaries and trustees or issuers.
