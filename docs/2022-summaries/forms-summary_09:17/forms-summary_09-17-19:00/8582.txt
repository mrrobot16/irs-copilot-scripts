Form 8582 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used to calculate and report passive activity loss limitations for taxpayers. The form is attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1041 and requires completion of several parts.

Part I of the form deals with rental real estate activities with active participation. It requires the taxpayer to report activities with net income, activities with net loss, and prior years' unallowed losses. These amounts are then combined to determine the total.

Part II is specific to special allowances for rental real estate activities with active participation. The taxpayer is required to enter the smaller of the loss on line 1d or the loss on line 3. They also need to enter $150,000 (or follow specific instructions for married filing separately) and their modified adjusted gross income.

Part III calculates the total losses allowed by adding the income from lines 1a and 2a.

Parts IV and V require the taxpayer to provide details of specific activities, including net income, net loss, unallowed loss, gain, and loss. These amounts are then entered on Part I.

Part VI is used if an amount is shown on Part II, Line 9, and requires the taxpayer to provide details of the activity, form or schedule, and line number to be reported.

Part VII deals with the allocation of unallowed losses and requires the taxpayer to provide details of the activity, form or schedule, and line number to be reported.

Part VIII calculates the allowed losses by subtracting the unallowed losses from the total losses reported.

Part IX is used when there are losses reported on two or more forms or schedules. The taxpayer needs to provide details of the activities, net losses, net income, and the resulting unallowed and allowed losses.

Overall, Form 8582 is a comprehensive document that helps taxpayers calculate and report passive activity loss limitations for their tax returns.
