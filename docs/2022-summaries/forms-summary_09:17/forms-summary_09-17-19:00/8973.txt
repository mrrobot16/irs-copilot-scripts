Form 8973 is a document used by Certified Professional Employer Organizations (CPEOs) to report information about their customers to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The form is divided into several parts.

Part 1 asks the filer to indicate the reason for filing the form, such as starting or ending a service contract or correcting a previously filed Form 8973.

Part 2 is for providing customer information, including the customer's employer identification number (EIN), name, trade name (if any), and address.

Part 3 is for providing CPEO information, including the CPEO's EIN, name, trade name (if any), and address.

Part 4 asks about the relationship between the CPEO and the customer, including whether there is a contract between them and whether the customer is a provider of employment-related services or a related party of the CPEO.

Part 5 is for the customer's signature, certifying the accuracy and completeness of the information provided.

Part 6 is for the CPEO's signature, certifying the accuracy and completeness of the information provided.

The form also includes a separate section for CPEOs to consent to the disclosure of tax information to the customer named in the form. This section requires the CPEO's signature, name, title, and EIN.

Overall, Form 8973 is used to report information about the relationship between a CPEO and its customers to the IRS, as well as to authorize the disclosure of tax information to the customer.
