Form 1099-SA is a document used to report distributions from Health Savings Accounts (HSA), Archer Medical Savings Accounts (MSA), or Medicare Advantage (MA) MSA. The form includes information about the payer, recipient, and the distribution itself. It is important for recipients to file Form 8853 or Form 8889 along with their Form 1040 or 1040-SR to report the distribution, even if it is not taxable. The form also provides instructions for reporting distributions and includes information about penalties and repayment options. The form is filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a copy is provided to the recipient for their records. The instructions for completing the form and filing electronically are available on the IRS website.
