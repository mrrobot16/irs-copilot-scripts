Form 8609 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the purpose of allocating and certifying the Low-Income Housing Credit. The form consists of two parts.

Part I of the form is used for the allocation of the credit. It includes sections for providing the address of the building, the name and address of the housing credit agency, and the name, address, and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the building owner receiving the allocation. Additionally, it requires the employer identification number of the agency and the building identification number (BIN). The form also asks for the date of allocation, the maximum housing credit dollar amount allowable, the maximum applicable credit percentage allowable, and the maximum qualified basis. There is also a section to indicate if the eligible basis used in the computation of the qualified basis was increased under the high-cost area provisions. Furthermore, the form asks for the percentage of the aggregate basis financed by tax-exempt bonds and the date the building was placed in service. There is an option to indicate if the date of allocation is in a calendar year 2021 or 2022 and if the building is located in a qualified disaster zone. Lastly, there are checkboxes to describe the allocation for the building, including whether it is newly constructed and federally subsidized, newly constructed and not federally subsidized, an existing building, or if it involves rehabilitation expenditures that are federally subsidized or not federally subsidized. There is also a checkbox for allocations subject to the nonprofit set-aside under section 42(h)(5).

Part II of the form is for the first-year certification and is completed by building owners with respect to the first year of the credit period. This section requires the eligible basis of the building and the original qualified basis of the building at the close of the first year of the credit period. Building owners are asked if they are treating the building as part of a multiple building project for purposes of section 42. There are also checkboxes to indicate if the building owner elects to reduce eligible basis under section 42(i)(2)(B) or to reduce eligible basis by disproportionate costs of non-low-income units under section 42(d)(3)(B). The form provides various election options, including electing to begin the credit period the first year after the building is placed in service, electing not to treat a large partnership as the taxpayer, electing the minimum set-aside requirement, and electing a deep rent skewed project. The form requires the signature of the taxpayer, the taxpayer identification number, the date, and the name of the taxpayer.

Overall, Form 8609 is a comprehensive document that serves as an allocation and certification tool for the Low-Income Housing Credit program.
