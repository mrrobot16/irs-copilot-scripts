Part I: Due Diligence Requirements - The preparer must check the appropriate box for the credits and/or HOH filing status claimed on the return and complete the related parts for each credit claimed.

Part II: Due Diligence Questions for Returns Claiming EIC - This part includes questions specific to the EIC, including determining eligibility and understanding the rules for claiming the credit.

Part III: Due Diligence Questions for Returns Claiming CTC/ACTC/ODC - This part includes questions specific to the CTC, ACTC, and ODC, including determining eligibility and understanding the rules for claiming the credit.

Part IV: Due Diligence Questions for Returns Claiming AOTC - This part includes questions specific to the AOTC, including verifying substantiation for the credit.

Part V: Due Diligence Questions for Claiming HOH - This part includes questions specific to the HOH filing status, including determining eligibility.

Part VI: Eligibility Certification - The preparer must certify that they have completed all due diligence requirements, including interviewing the taxpayer, documenting responses, reviewing information, completing the form truthfully and accurately, submitting the form as required, and retaining all necessary records.
