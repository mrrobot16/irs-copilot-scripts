Form 1125-E is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that must be attached to certain tax forms (Form 1120, 1120-C, 1120-F, 1120-REIT, 1120-RIC, or 1120S). It is used to report the compensation of officers for a business. This form should only be completed if the total receipts of the business are $500,000 or more. 

The form requires the following information for each officer:
- Name
- Social security number
- Percentage of time devoted to the business
- Percentage of stock owned
- Amount of compensation

The form also includes lines for totaling the compensation of all officers and subtracting any compensation already claimed on Form 1125-A or elsewhere on the tax return. The final result is then entered on Form 1120, page 1, line 12 or the appropriate line of the tax return.

The form includes an OMB number (1545-0123) and a reference to the IRS website for more information and instructions. It also includes a notice about the Paperwork Reduction Act.
