Schedule O (Form 1120) is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for a controlled group to consent and establish an apportionment plan. This form is to be attached to Form 1120, 1120-C, 1120-F, 1120-FSC, 1120-L, 1120-PC, 1120-REIT, or 1120-RIC. 

Part I of the form requires the controlled group to provide information about the type of group they belong to (parent-subsidiary, brother-sister, combined, or life insurance companies only) and the duration of their membership in the group. The corporation must also indicate whether they are adopting a new apportionment plan, amending an existing plan, terminating the current plan without adopting a new one, or terminating the current plan and adopting a new one. If the corporation is terminating the current plan, they must specify whether it was elected or required by the component members of the group. Additionally, the corporation must indicate whether there is currently no apportionment plan in effect, or if there is already an existing plan. If the group is adopting or amending a plan after the due date of the tax return, the corporation must determine if there is at least one year remaining on the statute of limitations for assessing any resulting deficiency. Lastly, if the corporation has a short tax year that does not include December 31, they must check the corresponding box.

Part II of the form provides space for the corporation to list the names and employer identification numbers of the group members, their tax year end, and various apportionment details such as accumulated earnings credit, penalty for failure to pay estimated tax, and any other relevant information.

This form is used to ensure proper apportionment and compliance within a controlled group for tax purposes.
