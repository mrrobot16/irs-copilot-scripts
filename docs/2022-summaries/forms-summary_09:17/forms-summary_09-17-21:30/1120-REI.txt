Form 1120-REIT is the U.S. Income Tax Return for Real Estate Investment Trusts. It is used by real estate investment trusts (REITs) to report their income, deductions, and tax liability to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 

The form includes several sections and schedules for reporting different types of income and deductions. It begins with general information about the REIT, including its name, address, and employer identification number. It also asks for information about the REIT's status, such as whether it has 100% owned subsidiaries or is a personal holding company.

The form then includes several parts for reporting different types of income and deductions. Part I is for reporting the REIT's taxable income, excluding income required to be reported in other parts of the form. Part II is for reporting income from foreclosure property. Part III is for reporting tax for failure to meet certain source-of-income requirements. And Part IV is for reporting tax on net income from prohibited transactions.

The form also includes schedules for reporting specific deductions and credits, such as the deduction for dividends paid and the foreign tax credit. There are also sections for reporting other information, such as the REIT's method of accounting, ownership of voting stock, and compliance with certain tax regulations.

The form ends with schedules for reporting the REIT's balance sheet, reconciliation of income per books with income per return, and analysis of unappropriated retained earnings per books.

Overall, Form 1120-REIT is a comprehensive tax return form specifically designed for real estate investment trusts to report their income and deductions to the IRS.
