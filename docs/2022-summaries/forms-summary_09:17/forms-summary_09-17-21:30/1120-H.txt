Form 1120-H is a U.S. Income Tax Return specifically designed for Homeowners Associations (HOAs). The form is used to report the association's income and expenses for the tax year. 

The form requires the association to provide basic information such as its name, address, and employer identification number. It also asks for the date the association was formed and whether there have been any changes to the association's name or address.

The form includes several sections to report the association's income and deductions. The association must report its total exempt function income, which must meet a 60% gross income test. It must also report its total expenditures made for purposes described in a 90% expenditure test.

The form provides separate lines to report various types of income, including dividends, taxable interest, gross rents, gross royalties, capital gain net income, and other income. It also provides lines to report deductions directly connected to the production of gross income, such as salaries and wages, repairs and maintenance, rents, taxes and licenses, interest, depreciation, and other deductions.

The form calculates the association's taxable income by subtracting the total deductions from the gross income. It then applies a specific deduction of $100.

The form includes sections to calculate the association's tax and payments. It requires the association to enter its taxable income and calculate the tax based on a specified percentage. It also provides lines to report tax credits, overpayments from previous years, estimated tax payments, and tax deposits made with Form 7004.

The form calculates the amount owed or overpaid by subtracting the total payments from the total tax. It provides options for the association to choose whether any overpayment should be credited to the next year's estimated tax or refunded.

The form must be signed by an authorized officer of the association under penalties of perjury. It also includes a section for the preparer's information, including their name, signature, and PTIN (Preparer Tax Identification Number).
