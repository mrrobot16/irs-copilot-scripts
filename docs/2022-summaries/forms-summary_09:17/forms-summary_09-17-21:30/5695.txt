Form 5695 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim residential energy credits on their tax return. The form is divided into two parts: Part I for Residential Clean Energy Credit and Part II for Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit.

In Part I, taxpayers can claim credits for qualified expenses related to solar electric property costs, solar water heating property costs, small wind energy property costs, geothermal heat pump property costs, and biomass fuel property costs. The total of these expenses is calculated on line 6a, and then multiplied by 30% on line 6b. The form also includes a section for qualified fuel cell property costs, where taxpayers can determine their credit based on the cost and kilowatt capacity of the property. The final credit amount is calculated on line 15, taking into account any credit carryforward from the previous year.

Part II of the form is for claiming the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit. Taxpayers can claim credits for qualified energy efficiency improvements made to their main home, such as insulation, exterior doors, metal or asphalt roofs, and energy-efficient windows. The total of these improvements is calculated on line 20 and multiplied by 10% on line 21. The form also includes a section for residential energy property costs, such as energy-efficient building property, qualified furnaces or boilers, and advanced main air circulating fans. The total of these costs is calculated on line 23. The final credit amount is calculated on line 30, taking into account any lifetime limitation and limitation based on tax liability.

Taxpayers are required to attach Form 5695 to their Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR when claiming residential energy credits. The form includes instructions and references to additional resources on the IRS website for further guidance.
