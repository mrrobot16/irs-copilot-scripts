Schedule S (Form 1120-F) is a tax form used by foreign corporations operating ships or aircraft in the United States to claim an exemption from income tax on their international operations under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code. The form is attached to Form 1120-F and requires the corporation to provide information about their qualified foreign status, the type of exemption granted by the foreign country of organization, and the gross income in various categories for which the exemption is being claimed. The form also includes sections for the stock ownership test, where the corporation must indicate the test under which the stock ownership requirements were satisfied, and provide details about the stock ownership and qualified shareholders. The form is used to determine if the corporation qualifies for the exemption and must be completed accurately and attached to the tax return.
