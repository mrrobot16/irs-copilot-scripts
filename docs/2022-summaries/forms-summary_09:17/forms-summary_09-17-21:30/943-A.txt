Form 943-A is a document used by agricultural employers in the United States to record their federal tax liability. It is filed with either Form 943 or Form 943-X. The form is to be completed by semiweekly schedule depositors or those who have become one due to having an accumulated tax liability of $100,000 or more in any month. The form includes sections for each month of the calendar year where the employer can enter their tax liability for each day of the month. The totals for each month are then added up to calculate the total tax liability for the year, which must match line 13 on Form 943. The form also provides instructions for further guidance.
