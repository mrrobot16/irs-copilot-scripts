Form 7207 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit. The form requires taxpayers to provide information about the components they produced in the United States and sold in their trade or business during the tax year to unrelated persons.

The form includes various sections for different types of eligible components, such as solar energy components, wind energy components, torque tube and structural fastener components, inverter components, electrode active materials, battery components, and critical minerals.

For each eligible component, taxpayers must provide the unit of measurement, the credit per unit, the number of units produced and sold (or sales price or costs), and calculate the amount of credit for each component.

There are also checkboxes to indicate whether the taxpayer has made an election under section 45X(a)(3)(B) for the tax year and whether the eligible components include property produced at a facility for which a credit under section 48C is being claimed.

The form also includes a section for taxpayers to report any advanced manufacturing production credit received from partnerships, S corporations, estates, and trusts.

Finally, taxpayers are instructed to add up the amounts in column (e) for lines 1 through 8 and report the total on Form 3800, Part III, line 1b. Estates and trusts have additional instructions for reporting the amount allocated to beneficiaries.

The form includes a website link for instructions and the latest information on Form 7207.
