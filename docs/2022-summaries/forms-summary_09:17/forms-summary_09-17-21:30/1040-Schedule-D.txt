Schedule D is a form used for reporting capital gains and losses on investments for tax purposes. It is attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. The form provides space to enter information about short-term and long-term capital gains and losses, including proceeds, cost or basis, adjustments, and the resulting gain or loss. It also includes sections for reporting gains or losses from partnerships, S corporations, estates, and trusts, as well as capital gain distributions and carryovers. The form provides instructions and references to other forms, such as Form 8949 and various worksheets, for completing the necessary calculations. The summary section at the end of the form helps determine the net gain or loss to be reported on the individual's tax return.
