Form 5713 is a tax form used by individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusts, and estates to report any operations or participation in an international boycott. The form collects information such as the filer's identifying information, total income, total assets, and details about any operations or agreements related to boycotting countries. The form also requires the filer to indicate if they have received requests to participate in a boycott or if they have entered into any agreements related to a boycott. If the answer to either question is yes, the filer must complete additional schedules. The form includes instructions and space for additional information if needed.
