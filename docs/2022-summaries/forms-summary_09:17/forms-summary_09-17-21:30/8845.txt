Form 8845 is a document issued by the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for taxpayers to claim the Indian Employment Credit. The form is used to calculate the credit amount based on qualified wages and qualified employee health insurance costs paid or incurred during the tax year.

The form consists of several lines where taxpayers enter the relevant information. Line 1 requires the total amount of qualified wages and qualified employee health insurance costs for the tax year. Line 2 is specifically for the calendar year 1993 and requires the same information. If there were no qualified wages or costs for that year, taxpayers should enter -0-.

Line 3 calculates the incremental increase by subtracting line 2 from line 1. If the result is zero or less, taxpayers should enter -0-. Line 4 instructs taxpayers to multiply line 3 by 20% (0.20). The instructions provide further details on the adjustment taxpayers must make to their deduction for salaries and wages.

Line 5 is for taxpayers who have received the Indian employment credit from partnerships, S corporations, cooperatives, estates, and trusts. Line 6 instructs taxpayers to add lines 4 and 5. For cooperatives, estates, and trusts, they should proceed to line 7. Partnerships and S corporations only need to report the amount calculated on line 6 on Schedule K. All other taxpayers should report this amount on Form 3800, Part III, line 1g.

Line 7 is for taxpayers to allocate the credit amount to patrons of the cooperative or beneficiaries of the estate or trust. The instructions provide further guidance on this allocation process. Line 8 is for cooperatives, estates, and trusts to subtract line 7 from line 6. The resulting amount should be reported on Form 3800, Part III, line 1g.

Taxpayers should refer to the instructions provided on the IRS website (www.irs.gov/Form8845) for further guidance and the latest information. The form includes the Paperwork Reduction Act Notice for reference.
