Form 8864 is a tax form provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim the Biodiesel, Renewable Diesel, or Sustainable Aviation Fuels Credit. The form must be attached to the taxpayer's tax return.

The form provides instructions and the latest information on how to claim the credit. It also includes a caution that taxpayers cannot claim amounts on Form 8864 that they have already claimed or will claim on other forms such as Form 720 (Schedule C), Form 8849, or Form 4136.

The sustainable aviation fuel credit is only available for fuel produced after 2022.

The form includes sections for taxpayers to report the type of fuel, the number of gallons sold or used, and the corresponding rate for each type of fuel. The form provides specific categories for biodiesel, agri-biodiesel, renewable diesel, and biodiesel mixtures.

Taxpayers must attach appropriate certificates and reseller statements to support their claims, and they must have no reason to believe that the information in the certificate or statement is false.

The form also includes sections for taxpayers who receive the credit from partnerships, S corporations, cooperatives, estates, and trusts. These taxpayers may need to report the credit on Schedule K or Form 3800, depending on their entity type.

The form concludes with a calculation of the total credit amount, which should be included in the taxpayer's income for the tax year.

Overall, Form 8864 provides a structured format for taxpayers to claim the Biodiesel, Renewable Diesel, or Sustainable Aviation Fuels Credit and ensures compliance with IRS requirements.
