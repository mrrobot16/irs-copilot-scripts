Schedule LEP (Form 1040) is a form provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers with limited English proficiency to request written communications from the IRS in a preferred language. The form should be attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, 1040-NR, 1040-PR, or 1040-SS. The form includes a list of languages, and the taxpayer can check only one language preference. It is important to note that immediate written communications in the requested language may not be received as the IRS is scheduled to begin providing translations in 2023. The form can be filed with the tax return and is not mandatory. If filing a joint return, both spouses can file separate forms if they have different language preferences. The SSN entered on the form should match the SSN on the tax return, and nonresidents or resident aliens without an SSN must apply for an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). The taxpayer should select one language from the list, and the selection will be effective for future written communications until changed or canceled. Special assistance is available for persons with limited English proficiency through programs like Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) or Tax Counseling for the Elderly sponsored by the IRS.
