Schedule Q (Form 5471) is a document issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used to report CFC (Controlled Foreign Corporation) income by CFC income groups. The form is attached to Form 5471 and is used to provide detailed information about the different categories of income earned by a foreign corporation.

The form requires the filer to enter the name of the person filing Form 5471, the identifying number, the name of the foreign corporation, and the EIN (if any). It also asks for a reference ID number.

The form instructs the filer to complete a separate Schedule Q for each applicable category of income. It provides separate lines for entering the category code, applicable grouping code (if category code PAS is entered), and the country code for sanctioned countries (if code 901j is entered).

The form also requires the filer to indicate whether the Schedule Q is being completed for U.S. source income or foreign source income. If it is being completed for FOGEI (Foreign Oil and Gas Extraction Income) or FORI (Foreign Oil Related Income) income, there is a box to check.

The form provides a table with columns for entering amounts in the functional currency of the foreign corporation. The columns include gross income, definitely related expenses, related person interest expense, other interest expense, research and experimental expenses, other expenses, current year tax on reattributed income from disregarded payments, current year tax on all other disregarded payments, other current year taxes, net income, foreign taxes for which credit is allowed (in U.S. dollars), average asset value, high tax election, loss allocation, and net income after loss allocation.

The form includes sections for reporting subpart F income groups, such as dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and annuities; net gain from certain property transactions; net gain from commodities transactions; net foreign currency gain; income equivalent to interest; and other income.

It also includes sections for reporting foreign base company sales income, foreign base company services income, full inclusion foreign base company income, insurance income, international boycott income, bribes, kickbacks, and other payments, section 901(j) income, recaptured subpart F income, tested income group, and residual income group.

The form concludes with a total section to summarize the income reported in the previous sections.

Important notes and instructions are provided throughout the form, and there is a reference to a computer-generated Schedule Q for additional guidance.

Overall, Schedule Q (Form 5471) is a detailed reporting document used to provide information about the different categories of income earned by a foreign corporation for tax purposes.
