Form 941 is the Employers Quarterly Federal Tax Return used by employers in the United States to report wages, tips, and other compensation paid to employees, as well as the federal income tax withheld from those payments. The form is divided into several parts, with Part 1 requiring information such as the number of employees and the amount of wages and taxes withheld. Part 2 asks about the deposit schedule and tax liability for the quarter, while Part 3 collects information about the business, such as whether it has closed or if it is a seasonal employer. Part 4 asks if there is a third-party designee authorized to discuss the return with the IRS, and Part 5 is for the signature of the taxpayer. The form also includes a payment voucher, Form 941-V, which is used to make a payment with Form 941. The form includes a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, which explains the purpose of the form and the confidentiality of the information provided. The estimated average time to complete and file Form 941 is provided, along with contact information for providing comments or suggestions to the IRS.
