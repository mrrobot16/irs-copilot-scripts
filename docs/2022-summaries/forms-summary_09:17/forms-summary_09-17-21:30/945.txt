Form 945 is an annual return form used by employers to report withheld federal income tax from pensions, annuities, IRAs, and gambling winnings. It is also used for reporting backup withholding. The form requires the employer to provide their name, employer identification number (EIN), trade name (if applicable), and address. The form includes sections for reporting the total taxes withheld, total deposits made, and any balance due or overpayment. It also includes a monthly summary of federal tax liability for monthly schedule depositors. The form includes a section for designating a third-party to discuss the return with the IRS. The form must be signed under penalties of perjury by the employer or preparer. The document also includes a payment voucher, Form 945-V, which should be used when making a payment with Form 945. The voucher requires the employer to provide their EIN, the amount of the payment, their business name, and address. The voucher should be detached and mailed with the payment and Form 945.
