Schedule 1 (Form 1040) is a document used to report additional income and adjustments to income for the tax year 2022. It is attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. The form includes two parts: Part I for reporting additional income and Part II for reporting adjustments to income.

Part I of the form is used to report various types of additional income, including taxable refunds, credits, or offsets of state and local income taxes, alimony received, business income or loss, other gains or losses, rental real estate income, farm income or loss, unemployment compensation, and other types of income such as net operating loss, gambling winnings, cancellation of debt, foreign earned income exclusion, and more. Taxpayers are required to provide specific details and attach supporting schedules or forms for certain types of income.

Part II of the form is used to report adjustments to income. This includes deductions such as educator expenses, certain business expenses of reservists, performing artists, and fee-basis government officials, health savings account deduction, moving expenses for members of the Armed Forces, self-employment tax deduction, self-employed retirement plan contributions, self-employed health insurance deduction, penalty on early withdrawal of savings, alimony paid, IRA deduction, student loan interest deduction, and other adjustments related to jury duty pay, rental of personal property, Olympic and Paralympic medals, reforestation amortization and expenses, repayment of supplemental unemployment benefits, contributions to pension plans, attorney fees and court costs, housing deduction, excess deductions of section 67(e) expenses, and other adjustments.

After reporting all additional income and adjustments to income, taxpayers are instructed to add up the totals and enter them on the appropriate lines of Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form includes instructions for each line item and provides space to list any other types of income or adjustments not specifically mentioned on the form.
