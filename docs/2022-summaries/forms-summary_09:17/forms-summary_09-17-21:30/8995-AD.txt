Schedule D (Form 8995-A) is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers who are patrons of agricultural or horticultural cooperatives. This form is used to calculate the patron reduction amount that will be entered on Form 8995-A.

The form consists of several sections:

1a: Trade, business, or aggregation name
1b: Taxpayer identification number
2: Qualified business income allocable to qualified payments received from the cooperative
3: Line 2 multiplied by 9% (0.09)
4: W-2 wages from trade or business allocable to the qualified payments
5: Line 4 multiplied by 50% (0.50)
6: Patron reduction amount, which is the smaller of line 3 or line 5. This amount should be entered on Form 8995-A, line 14, for the corresponding trade, business, or aggregation.

Taxpayers should attach Schedule D to Form 8995-A and refer to the IRS website for instructions and the latest information. If a taxpayer has more than three trades, businesses, or aggregations, they should attach as many Schedule D forms as needed.

The form also includes a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, which provides information regarding the collection of personal information and the burden of complying with the form.
