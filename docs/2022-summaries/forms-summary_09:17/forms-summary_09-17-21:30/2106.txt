Form 2106 is a document provided by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used to report employee business expenses and reimbursements for certain individuals, including Armed Forces reservists, qualified performing artists, fee-basis state or local government officials, and employees with impairment-related work expenses.

The form consists of two parts. Part I is used to report employee business expenses and reimbursements. It includes various categories such as vehicle expenses, parking fees, tolls, transportation, travel expenses, and other business expenses. There is also a section for meals expenses. The total expenses are calculated by adding up the amounts in each category.

If there were no reimbursements received, the total expenses are entered on line 8. If there were reimbursements received, they are entered on line 7. The difference between the total expenses and reimbursements is calculated on line 8. If this difference is zero or less, it is entered as -0-. If the reimbursements are greater than the total expenses, the excess is reported as income on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

Part II of the form is specifically for claiming vehicle expenses. It includes sections for general information about the vehicle, such as the date it was placed in service, total miles driven during the year, business miles, commuting miles, and other miles. There are also questions about personal use of the vehicle and evidence to support the deduction. The form provides options for calculating vehicle expenses using either the standard mileage rate or actual expenses.

Overall, Form 2106 is used to report and calculate deductible employee business expenses and reimbursements, with a specific focus on vehicle expenses for those who qualify. It must be attached to the individual's tax return (Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR) and the information entered on the form may impact the individual's tax liability.
