Form 8957 is a registration form used by foreign financial institutions to comply with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). The form is divided into two parts.

Part 1 requires the financial institution to provide basic information such as its type, legal name, country/jurisdiction of residence for tax purposes, tax ID, and FATCA classification. The financial institution must also provide its mailing address.

Part 1 also asks whether the financial institution has a withholding agreement with the IRS as a Qualified Intermediary (QI), Withholding Foreign Partnership (WP), or Withholding Foreign Trust (WT). The financial institution must indicate whether it intends to maintain its status as a QI, WP, or WT.

If the financial institution maintains a branch outside of its country/jurisdiction of tax residence, it must provide information about the branch and whether it is a tax resident of the United States or maintains a branch in the United States.

Part 1 concludes with the information of the FATCA Responsible Officer (RO) for the financial institution, including their business title, legal name, address, telephone number, fax number, and email address.

Part 2 is specifically for lead financial institutions of an Expanded Affiliated Group. The financial institution must provide the legal name, country/jurisdiction of residence for tax purposes, and FATCA classification for each member of the group.

The form must be signed by the RO or an authorized individual, certifying the accuracy and completeness of the information provided.

The IRS strongly recommends registering online at www.irs.gov/FATCA instead of using the paper form, as it will expedite the processing time.
