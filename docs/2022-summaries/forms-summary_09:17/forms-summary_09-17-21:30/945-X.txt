Form 945-X is a form used by employers to correct administrative errors made on Form 945, which is the Annual Return of Withheld Federal Income Tax. This form is used to either adjust the return of withheld federal income tax or claim a refund for overreported amounts. The form must be completed for each year that needs correction and both pages must be completed. The form includes various sections for entering corrections for different lines related to federal income tax withheld and backup withholding. The total corrected amount is calculated by subtracting the amount originally reported or previously corrected from the total corrected amount. If the total corrected amount is less than zero, it can be applied as a credit to the Form 945 for the tax period being filed. If the total corrected amount is more than zero, it indicates the amount owed, which must be paid when filing the return. The form also includes sections for explaining the corrections and a declaration of accuracy and completeness. Preparers must sign the form and provide their information if applicable.
