Form 8275 is a disclosure statement that taxpayers can attach to their tax return to provide additional information about certain items or positions they have taken on their return. It should not be used to disclose items that are contrary to Treasury regulations; instead, a separate form, Form 8275-R, should be used for that purpose. The form includes sections for general information about the items being disclosed, a detailed explanation of those items, and information about any pass-through entities involved. The form also provides space for taxpayers to provide additional explanations if needed.
