Form W-8BEN-E is a certificate of status for beneficial owners of income subject to United States tax withholding and reporting. It is used by entities to declare their status for tax purposes. The form includes sections for identifying the beneficial owner, indicating the entity type, and determining the entity's status under various tax regulations. The form also includes sections for claiming tax treaty benefits, certifying certain exemptions or statuses, and providing information on substantial U.S. owners for passive non-financial foreign entities. The form must be signed by an authorized individual and can be provided to withholding agents or payers but should not be sent to the IRS.
