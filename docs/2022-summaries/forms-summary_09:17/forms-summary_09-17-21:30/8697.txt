Form 8697 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States for taxpayers to compute interest under the look-back method for completed long-term contracts. The form includes sections for both the Regular Method and the Simplified Marginal Impact Method.

The Regular Method section requires the taxpayer to provide information about their taxable income or loss for prior years, adjustments to income for post-February 1986 contracts, adjusted taxable income for look-back purposes, income tax liability, and the calculation of interest due or to be refunded.

The Simplified Marginal Impact Method section is for taxpayers who choose to use a simplified method for computing interest. It requires the taxpayer to provide the date of each prior year, adjustments to regular taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income for post-February 1986 contracts, the calculation of increase or decrease in regular tax and alternative minimum tax, and the calculation of interest due or to be refunded.

The form also includes spaces for the taxpayer's identifying information, such as name, address, and identifying number, as well as spaces for signatures and preparer information.

Taxpayers are instructed to refer to the IRS website for the latest instructions and information regarding Form 8697.
