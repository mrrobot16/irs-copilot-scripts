Form 8844 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim the Empowerment Zone Employment Credit. This form should be attached to the taxpayer's tax return. The form requires the taxpayer to enter the total qualified empowerment zone wages paid or incurred during the current year. The taxpayer then multiplies this amount by 20% (0.20) to calculate the credit. The form also includes sections for partnerships, S corporations, cooperatives, estates, and trusts to report their specific credit amounts. Cooperatives, estates, and trusts must subtract any amount allocated to their patrons or beneficiaries before reporting the credit on Form 3800, Part III, line 3. The form provides instructions and directs taxpayers to visit the IRS website for additional guidance and the latest information.
