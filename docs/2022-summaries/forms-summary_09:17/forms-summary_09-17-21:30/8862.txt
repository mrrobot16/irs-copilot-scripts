Form 8862 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for individuals who want to claim certain tax credits after the credits were previously reduced or disallowed for reasons other than math or clerical errors. The form is used to claim the Earned Income Credit (EIC), Child Tax Credit (CTC), Refundable Child Tax Credit (RCTC), Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), Credit for Other Dependents (ODC), and American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC). 

The form is divided into several parts, each corresponding to a specific credit. In Part I, the taxpayer must enter the tax year for which they are filing the form. In Part II, for the Earned Income Credit, the taxpayer must indicate whether their EIC was reduced or disallowed due to incorrect reporting of earned income or investment income. If not, they must answer additional questions related to qualifying children. 

Part III pertains to the Child Tax Credit, Additional Child Tax Credit, and Credit for Other Dependents. The taxpayer must provide the names of the children or dependents they are claiming the credit for and answer questions regarding their eligibility and residency status. 

Part IV is for the American Opportunity Tax Credit and requires the taxpayer to provide information about the students they are claiming the credit for and whether the credit has been claimed in previous years. 

Lastly, Part V is for situations where a child qualifies as a dependent for more than one person. The taxpayer must provide information about the child's living arrangements and any other individuals who lived with the child for more than half the year. 

The form includes cautionary notes and instructions for each section, and taxpayers are advised to refer to the IRS website for the most up-to-date instructions and information.
