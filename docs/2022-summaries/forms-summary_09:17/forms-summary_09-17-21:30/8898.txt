Form 8898 is a statement that individuals must file with the IRS if they begin or end their bona fide residence in a U.S. possession. The form requires individuals to provide their personal information, such as their name, social security number, and addresses before and after the change in residence status. 

The form also includes several sections where individuals must provide information regarding their presence in the United States or the U.S. possession, their worldwide gross income, and their connection to the United States. They must also indicate if they had a tax home outside the U.S. possession, a closer connection to the United States or a foreign country, and if they are using the year-of-the-move exception.

Additionally, the form asks individuals to provide information about their principal permanent home, the location of their immediate family, the location of their automobile(s), and the location of their personal belongings. They must also provide information about their banking activities, business activities, voter registration, homestead exemption, and the addresses they listed as their residence on official documents.

The form also includes sections where individuals must provide information about the source of their income, such as whether they had an office in the U.S. possession, received compensation for personal services, manufactured an article for sale, or sold or exchanged appreciated property.

Finally, individuals must sign and date the form before mailing it to the IRS at the designated address.
