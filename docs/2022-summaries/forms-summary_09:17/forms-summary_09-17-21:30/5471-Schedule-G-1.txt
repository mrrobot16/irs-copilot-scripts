Schedule G-1 (Form 5471) is a document that must be attached to Form 5471, which is used to report information about foreign corporations with which a U.S. taxpayer has a certain relationship. This particular schedule is used to report information about a Cost Sharing Arrangement (CSA) in which the foreign corporation was a participant during the tax year.

The schedule begins by requesting a brief description of the CSA. It then asks whether the foreign corporation became a participant in the CSA during the tax year and whether the CSA was in effect before January 5, 2009.

Next, it asks for the foreign corporation's share of reasonably anticipated benefits for the CSA during the tax year, expressed as a percentage.

The schedule then asks whether a U.S. taxpayer made any platform contributions to the CSA during the tax year. If yes, the present value of the platform contributions in U.S. dollars should be entered. It also asks for the method used to determine the price of the platform contribution transaction(s).

The schedule also asks for information about stock-based compensation deductions claimed by the filer for the tax year, as well as deductions for stock-based compensation that was granted during the term of the CSA and is directly identified with or reasonably allocable to the intangible development activity under the CSA.

Additionally, it asks whether any stock-based compensation was granted during the term of the CSA to individuals who performed functions in business activities that generate cost shared intangibles but were not treated as directly identified with or reasonably allocable to the intangible development activity.

Finally, the schedule asks for the total amount of intangible development costs for the CSA and the amount of intangible development costs allocable to the foreign corporation based on its reasonably anticipated benefits share.

The schedule reminds filers to report all amounts in U.S. dollars and to complete a separate Schedule G-1 for each CSA in which the foreign corporation was a participant during the tax year.
