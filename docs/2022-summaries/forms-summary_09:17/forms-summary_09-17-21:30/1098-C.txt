Form 1098-C is used to report contributions of motor vehicles, boats, and airplanes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The form includes information about the donor, donee, and the donated vehicle. It also includes checkboxes for the donee to certify certain details about the donation, such as whether the vehicle was sold to an unrelated party, whether it will be transferred for money or services, and whether goods or services were provided in exchange for the vehicle. The form provides instructions for donors on how to claim a deduction for the contribution and for donees on how to complete and file the form.
