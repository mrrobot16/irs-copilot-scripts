Form 5884-D is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax-exempt organizations affected by qualified disasters to claim the Employee Retention Credit. This form is filed separately and should not be attached to the tax return. The form requires the organization's name, employer identification number, trade name (if applicable), and address. It also asks whether the organization is a qualified tax-exempt organization and whether it is a federally chartered corporation or a federal, state, or local college, university, hospital, or medical care entity. If the organization meets the criteria, it can proceed to claim the credit.

The form then asks for information about the applicable qualified disaster zones, the employment tax return filed, and the employment tax period for which the organization is claiming the credit. It also requires the organization to enter the total qualified wages for the 2020 qualified disaster employee retention credit paid to eligible employees. This amount is multiplied by 40% to calculate the credit.

The form also asks for the number of eligible employees who earned the qualified wages, the total amount of credits claimed on prior Forms 5884-D, and the organization's total taxable social security wages and tips reported on the return. These amounts are used to calculate the credit.

The form then requires the organization to subtract the total credits claimed on prior forms from the calculated credit amount. If the result is less than zero, the organization enters -0-. The smaller amount between this result and the calculated credit is entered as the credit claimed for the employment tax period. If the total credits claimed on prior forms are greater than the calculated credit, the organization owes the difference.

The form concludes with a declaration of accuracy and a signature section for an officer of the organization. The completed form should be sent to the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Ogden, UT 84201.
