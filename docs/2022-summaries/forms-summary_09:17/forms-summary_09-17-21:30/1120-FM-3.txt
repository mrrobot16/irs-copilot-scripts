- This part involves reconciling various income (loss) items between the income statement and the tax return. It includes items such as gross receipts, dividends, interest income, rental income, royalty income, net income from partnerships and pass-through entities, and other income items.

Part III: Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) per Income Statement
- This part focuses on reconciling various expense/deduction items between the income statement and the tax return. It includes items such as income tax expenses, compensation expenses, stock option expenses, pension and profit-sharing expenses, depreciation expenses, interest expenses, rental expenses, and other expense items.

The form requires the corporation to provide detailed information for each income (loss) item and expense/deduction item, including temporary differences, permanent differences, and other permanent differences for allocations to non-effectively connected income (ECI) and ECI.
