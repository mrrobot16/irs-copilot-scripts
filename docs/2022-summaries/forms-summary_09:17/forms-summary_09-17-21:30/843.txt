Form 843 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim a refund or request an abatement of certain taxes, fees, penalties, or interest. The form is used for various purposes, including refund claims for taxes other than income taxes or certain employer taxes, abatement of FUTA tax or certain excise taxes, and refund or abatement of interest, penalties, or additions to tax for specific reasons. However, the form cannot be used for overpayments of income taxes or certain employer taxes, refunds of excise taxes related to nontaxable use or sale of fuels, or overpayments of excise taxes reported on specific forms.

The form requires the taxpayer to provide personal information, such as their name, social security number, address, and employer identification number (if applicable). They must also indicate the specific tax or fee to be refunded or abated, as well as the type of penalty if applicable. The taxpayer must select the reason for their request for refund or abatement, such as interest assessed due to IRS errors or delays, penalties resulting from erroneous written advice from the IRS, or reasonable cause for not assessing a penalty or addition to tax.

The taxpayer must provide the date(s) of payment(s) and indicate the type of fee or return to which the tax, interest, penalty, or addition to tax relates. They must also provide an explanation for why they believe their claim or request should be allowed, along with the computation of the amount requested on line 2. The form must be signed by the taxpayer and, if applicable, their spouse for joint returns. Corporate claims must be signed by an authorized corporate officer.

The form includes a declaration of accuracy and completeness, and if a preparer is involved, their information must also be provided. The form concludes with a section for the preparer's name, signature, and date.

It is important to note that the document provided is a blank form with instructions, and the summary above provides an overview of the purpose and sections of the form. The specific details and requirements for each section can be found in the separate instructions provided by the IRS.
