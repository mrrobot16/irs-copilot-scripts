Form 8936 is a tax form used by individuals in the United States to claim a credit for qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles. The form is divided into three parts.

Part I is for calculating the tentative credit for each vehicle. The taxpayer must provide the year, make, and model of the vehicle, as well as the vehicle identification number and the date it was placed in service. The cost of the vehicle is entered, along with a phase-out percentage. The tentative credit is then calculated by multiplying the cost of the vehicle by the phase-out percentage.

Part II is for taxpayers who use their vehicle for business or investment purposes. The business/investment use percentage is entered, and the tentative credit is multiplied by this percentage. If the vehicle has at least four wheels, the taxpayer may be eligible for a section 179 expense deduction. The deduction is subtracted from the tentative credit, and the result is multiplied by 10% to determine the maximum credit per vehicle. The amount from line 6 is entered on line 11, and columns (a) and (b) are added together on line 12.

Part III is for calculating the credit for the personal use part of the vehicle. If Part II was skipped, the amount from line 4c is entered on line 15. If Part II was completed, line 6 is subtracted from line 4c. The result is multiplied by 10% to determine the maximum credit per vehicle. For vehicles with four or more wheels placed in service before 2023, the amount from line 15 is entered on line 18. For vehicles placed in service after 2022, the taxpayer must refer to the instructions. Columns (a) and (b) are added together on line 19.

The amount from Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 18 is entered on line 20. Personal credits from Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR are entered on line 21. Line 21 is subtracted from line 20, and if the result is zero or less, the taxpayer cannot claim the personal use part of the credit. The smaller of line 19 or line 22 is entered on line 23 and reported on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 6f.
