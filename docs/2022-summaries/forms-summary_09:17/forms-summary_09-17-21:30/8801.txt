Form 8801 is a document issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used to calculate the Credit for Prior Year Minimum Tax for individuals, estates, and trusts. 

The form consists of three parts. 

Part I involves calculating the Net Minimum Tax on Exclusion Items by combining certain lines from the taxpayer's 2021 Form 6251. Adjustments and preferences treated as exclusion items are also entered. 

Part II focuses on the Minimum Tax Credit and Carryforward to 2023. It includes calculations based on the taxpayer's 2021 Form 6251 or 2021 Form 1041, Schedule I. The net minimum tax on exclusion items is subtracted, and the result is used to determine the minimum tax credit and any carryforward to the following year. 

Part III is optional and is used for tax computation using maximum capital gains rates. It involves calculations based on the taxpayer's 2021 Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet, 2021 Schedule D Tax Worksheet, or 2021 Schedule D (Form 1041). 

The form includes various lines for entering amounts, multiplying figures by percentages, and subtracting or adding values to determine the final minimum tax credit. The calculated credit is then entered on the taxpayer's Form 1040, 1040-SR, 1040-NR, or 1041.
