Form 1040-NR Schedule OI is a document that taxpayers must complete and attach to their Form 1040-NR when filing their U.S. income tax return. The form requests various pieces of information related to the taxpayer's citizenship, residency, visa status, presence in the United States, filing history, trust ownership, compensation, income exempt from tax under a treaty, and elections related to income from real property located in the United States. The form provides checkboxes and spaces for taxpayers to provide their answers and details where applicable. The completed form helps the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) gather additional information necessary for processing the taxpayer's return accurately.
