Form 3115 is an application for a change in accounting method for tax purposes. It is used by taxpayers in the United States to request approval from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to change the way they account for income, expenses, and other items on their tax returns. The form requires the taxpayer to provide information such as their identification number, principal business activity, and the tax year for which the change is being requested. It also asks for details about the specific change being requested, such as the type of accounting method being changed (e.g., depreciation or amortization) and the present and proposed methods. The form includes various schedules for specific types of changes, such as changes related to long-term contracts or depreciation. The taxpayer must provide all relevant information and attach any necessary statements or documentation to support their request. The form also includes sections for the taxpayer to indicate if they are a member of a consolidated group or if they have any pending requests for private letter rulings or technical advice. The taxpayer must sign the form under penalties of perjury, declaring that the information provided is true, correct, and complete.
