Schedule D (Form 941) is a document used by employers in the United States to report discrepancies between their quarterly federal tax returns (Form 941) and wage and tax statements (Form W-2). The purpose of this schedule is to ensure that the wages reported on Form 941 match those reported on Form W-2 and that the appropriate taxes have been paid. 

The schedule is divided into three parts. 

Part 1 asks background questions to determine the reason for the discrepancies. Employers must indicate whether they are filing the schedule after a statutory merger or consolidation, or after an acquisition using an alternate procedure. They also need to provide the effective date of the transaction and information about the other party involved. 

Part 2 is where employers report the discrepancies for each category, including social security wages, Medicare wages and tips, social security tips, federal income tax withheld, and advance earned income credit payments. 

If employers are filing for more than one transaction in a calendar year, they must complete Part 3. This part requires them to file a separate Schedule D (Form 941) for each transaction and report the discrepancies for each category. 

The schedule is used to help the IRS resolve discrepancies without contacting the employer directly. Employers are advised to read the instructions before filling out the schedule.
