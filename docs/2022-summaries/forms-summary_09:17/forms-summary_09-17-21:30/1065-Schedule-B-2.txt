Schedule B-2 is a form that is attached to Form 1065 or Form 1066 for certain partnerships with 100 or fewer partners to elect out of the centralized partnership audit regime. The form requires the partnership to list all eligible partners, including individuals, C corporations, foreign entities that would be treated as C corporations if they were domestic, S corporations, and estates of deceased partners. The form also requires the partnership to list all shareholders of any S corporation that is a partner. The total number of schedules K-1 required to be issued by the partnership and any S corporation partners is also calculated. If the total number of schedules K-1 is more than 100, the partnership cannot make the election.
