Form 8621-A is a tax form used by shareholders of a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) to make certain late elections to end treatment as a PFIC. The form is filed separately from the shareholder's income tax return. The form includes sections for different types of elections, including late deemed dividend elections and late deemed sale elections, for both former PFICs and Section 1297(e) PFICs. The form also includes sections for providing information about the termination date or CFC qualification date, as well as the shareholder's pro rata share of post-1986 earnings and profits. The form concludes with a computation of tax and interest due, including a balance sheet for the election year. The form also includes a closing agreement between the shareholder and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, which confirms the agreed-upon determinations and resolutions regarding the late elections.
