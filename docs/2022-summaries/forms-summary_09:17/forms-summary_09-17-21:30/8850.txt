Form 8850 is a document used by job applicants and employers in the United States to request certification for the Work Opportunity Credit. The form asks job applicants to provide their personal information, such as their name, social security number, address, and telephone number. It also asks applicants to check boxes indicating if they meet certain criteria for the credit, such as being a member of a family that has received assistance from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or being a veteran who has received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.

The form also includes sections for employers to fill out, including their name, address, and contact information. Employers are asked to indicate if the applicant is a member of a targeted group and to sign the form under penalties of perjury.

The second page of the form includes a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, which explains how the information provided on the form will be used and disclosed. It also provides estimated times for completing and filing the form, as well as contact information for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) if the user has any comments or suggestions.

Overall, Form 8850 is a necessary document for job applicants and employers to request certification for the Work Opportunity Credit, a tax credit available to employers who hire individuals from certain targeted groups.
