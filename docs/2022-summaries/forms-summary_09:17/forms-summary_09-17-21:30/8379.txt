Form 8379, titled "Injured Spouse Allocation," is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim their share of a joint tax refund when their portion is being used to pay the past-due debts of their spouse. The form includes several parts that must be completed by the taxpayer.

Part I of the form determines whether the taxpayer should file Form 8379. The taxpayer must indicate the tax year for which they are filing the form and answer questions about filing a joint return and whether the IRS used the joint overpayment to pay any legally enforceable past-due debts owed only by their spouse.

If the taxpayer is not legally obligated to pay the past-due amount or if they were a resident of a community property state and their marriage was recognized under the laws of that state, they should not file the form.

Part II of the form requires the taxpayer to provide information about the joint return for which they are filing the form, including the names and social security numbers of both spouses. The taxpayer can also indicate if they want their refund issued in both names or if they want it mailed to a different address.

Part III of the form is for the allocation between spouses of items on the joint return, such as income, deductions, and credits. The taxpayer must enter the amounts allocated to the injured spouse and the other spouse.

Part IV is for the taxpayer's signature and declaration that the information provided on the form is true, correct, and complete. If the taxpayer is using a paid preparer, the preparer must also sign the form.

The form includes instructions and a website link for additional information. It is important for taxpayers to consult the instructions and seek professional advice if needed to ensure the form is completed accurately.
