Schedule F (Form 1040) is a document used to report profit or loss from farming activities for tax purposes in the United States. It is to be attached to Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, Form 1040-NR, Form 1041, or Form 1065. The form requires the taxpayer to provide their name, social security number, and other relevant information.

The form is divided into several parts. Part I is for reporting farm income using the cash method, while Part II is for reporting farm expenses using both the cash and accrual methods. Part III is specifically for reporting farm income using the accrual method.

The form includes various sections for reporting different sources of farm income, such as sales of purchased livestock, sales of livestock and other products raised, cooperative distributions, agricultural program payments, crop insurance proceeds, and custom hire income. It also includes sections for reporting various farm expenses, such as car and truck expenses, chemicals, conservation expenses, depreciation, employee benefit programs, feed, fertilizers, freight and trucking, gasoline and fuel, insurance, interest, labor hired, pension and profit-sharing plans, rent or lease, repairs and maintenance, seeds and plants, storage and warehousing, supplies, taxes, utilities, veterinary and medicine expenses, and other expenses.

The form provides spaces for entering specific amounts for each income and expense category, and also calculates the net farm profit or loss by subtracting total expenses from gross income. If there is a profit, the taxpayer is instructed to stop and report the profit accordingly. If there is a loss, the taxpayer is instructed to complete additional lines and check the box that describes their investment in the farming activity.

The form also includes a section called Part IV, which provides a list of principal agricultural activity codes that classify farms based on their primary activity. Taxpayers are required to select the code that best identifies their primary farming activity and enter it on the form.

Overall, Schedule F is a detailed form that allows taxpayers to report their farming income and expenses accurately for tax purposes.
