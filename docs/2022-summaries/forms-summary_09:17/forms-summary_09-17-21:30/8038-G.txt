Form 8038-G is an information return for tax-exempt governmental bonds. It is used by issuers to report details about the bonds issued, including the reporting authority, issuer's name and employer identification number, communication contact information, and bond details such as issue date, name, CUSIP number, and type of issue. The form also requires information about the uses of the bond proceeds, including accrued interest, bond issuance costs, credit enhancement, reserve or replacement funds, and refunding of prior bonds. If applicable, the form includes sections for describing refunded bonds, state volume cap allocation, guaranteed investment contracts, pooled financings, loans made from proceeds of another tax-exempt issue, small issuer exception, arbitrage rebate penalty election, hedges, remediation of nonqualified bonds, monitoring of section 148 requirements, and reimbursement of expenditures. The form must be signed by the issuer's authorized representative and includes a consent for the IRS to disclose the issuer's return information to the authorized person. The form is to be completed by the issuer or their paid preparer.
