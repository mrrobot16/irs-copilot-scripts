Form 8915-D is a document issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used to report qualified 2019 disaster retirement plan distributions and repayments. This form should be attached to the taxpayer's 2022 Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form contains two parts: Part I for qualified 2019 disaster distributions from retirement plans other than IRAs, and Part II for qualified 2019 disaster distributions from traditional, SEP, SIMPLE, and Roth IRAs.

In both parts, the taxpayer is required to enter the amounts from their previous year's Form 8915-D, if applicable. They also need to calculate the excess repayment from 2021 and any repayments made before filing their 2022 tax return. The form provides instructions on how to calculate these amounts.

The taxpayer must then subtract the excess repayment and any prior year carrybacks from the total amount of distributions and repayments to determine the amount subject to tax in 2022. This amount should be included in the total on their 2022 Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form also includes sections for the taxpayer's personal information, such as their name, social security number, and address. There is a declaration section where the taxpayer must sign under penalties of perjury, confirming that the information provided on the form is true, correct, and complete.

The form provides additional instructions and information for taxpayers, including where to find the latest information and instructions on the IRS website (www.irs.gov/Form8915D), and how to handle amended returns or foreign addresses.

It is important for taxpayers to consult the instructions and seek professional advice if needed to ensure accurate completion of Form 8915-D and compliance with IRS regulations.
