Schedule M-3 is a form that is attached to Form 1120-S, which is used to report the income and deductions of S corporations in the United States. Schedule M-3 is specifically for S corporations with total assets of $10 million or more.

The form is divided into three parts. 

Part I requires the corporation to provide financial information and reconcile its net income (loss) per its income statement with its net income (loss) per its books and records. The corporation must indicate whether it prepared a certified audited non-tax-basis income statement or a non-tax-basis income statement for the period covered by the tax year. If the corporation prepared a certified audited non-tax-basis income statement, it skips line 1b and completes lines 2 through 11 with respect to that income statement. If not, it proceeds to line 1b. Line 4a requires the corporation to enter its worldwide consolidated net income (loss) from the income statement source identified in Part I, line 1. The corporation must also indicate the accounting standard used for line 4a.

Part II is a reconciliation of the net income (loss) per the corporation's income statement with the total income (loss) per its tax return.
