The Schedule SE is a form used by self-employed individuals to calculate and report their self-employment tax. It is to be attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. The form includes two parts.

Part I is for calculating self-employment tax. It begins by providing instructions for individuals who are ministers, members of religious orders, or Christian Science practitioners and have other net earnings from self-employment. It then instructs individuals to skip certain lines if they use the farm optional method or the nonfarm optional method. Line 1a is for reporting net farm profit or loss, while line 1b is for reporting Conservation Reserve Program payments included on Schedule F or Schedule K-1. Line 2 is for reporting net profit or loss from non-farm self-employment. Line 3 is the sum of lines 1a, 1b, and 2. Line 4a instructs individuals to multiply line 3 by 92.35%, unless the amount is less than $400 due to Conservation Reserve Program payments. Line 4b is for entering the total of lines 15 and 17 if the optional methods are elected. Line 4c is the sum of lines 4a and 4b. Line 5a is for reporting church employee income from Form W-2, and line 5b is the result of multiplying line 5a by 92.35%. Line 6 is the sum of lines 4c and 5b. Line 7 provides the maximum amount of combined wages and self-employment earnings subject to social security tax or the 6.2% portion of the 7.65% railroad retirement tax for 2022. Line 8a is for reporting total social security wages and tips, while lines 8b and 8c are for reporting unreported tips subject to social security tax and wages subject to social security tax from Form 8919, respectively. Line 8d is the sum of lines 8a, 8b, and 8c. Line 9 is the result of subtracting line 8d from line 7. Line 10 is the result of multiplying the smaller of line 6 or line 9 by 12.4%. Line 11 is the result of multiplying line 6 by 2.9%. Line 12 is the sum of lines 10 and 11 and should be entered on Schedule 2, line 4. Line 13 is the deduction for one-half of self-employment tax, which is the result of multiplying line 12 by 50%, and should be entered on Schedule 1, line 15.

Part II provides optional methods for figuring net earnings. The farm optional method can be used if gross farm income is not more than $9,060 or net farm profits are less than $6,540. The maximum income for optional methods is $6,040. Line 15 is the smaller of two-thirds of gross farm income or $6,040. The nonfarm optional method can be used if net nonfarm profits are less than $6,540 and less than 72.189% of gross nonfarm income, and if there were net earnings from self-employment of at least $400 in 2 of the prior 3 years. Line 16 is the result of subtracting line 15 from line 14. Line 17 is the smaller of two-thirds of gross nonfarm income or the amount on line 16.
