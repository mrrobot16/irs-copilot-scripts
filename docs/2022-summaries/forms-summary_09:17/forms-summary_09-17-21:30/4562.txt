Form 4562 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States for taxpayers to report depreciation and amortization expenses related to their business activities. The form is used to calculate deductions for the depreciation of property, including information on listed property such as automobiles, vehicles, aircraft, and property used for entertainment or recreation.

The form is divided into several parts. Part I is used to elect to expense certain property under Section 179 of the tax code. It requires taxpayers to provide information on the maximum amount allowed for deduction, the total cost of Section 179 property placed in service, the threshold cost of Section 179 property, and any reduction in limitation.

Part II is used to report the special depreciation allowance for qualified property placed in service during the tax year, excluding listed property. Part III is used for reporting MACRS depreciation for assets placed in service in previous tax years and assets placed in service during the current tax year using the General Depreciation System or the Alternative Depreciation System.

Part IV provides a summary of the deductions calculated in Parts I, II, and III. Part V is specifically for reporting listed property, including details on depreciation and other information. It includes sections for evidence of business/investment use, cost or basis of the property, recovery period, depreciation method, and deduction.

Part VI is used for reporting amortization expenses, including the description of costs, the date amortization begins, the amortizable amount, the code section, and the amortization period or percentage.

Taxpayers are instructed to attach Form 4562 to their tax return and refer to the IRS website for instructions and the latest information. The form includes spaces for the taxpayer's name, business or activity, identifying number, and the attachment sequence number.
