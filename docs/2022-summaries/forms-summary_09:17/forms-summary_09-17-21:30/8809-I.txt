Form 8809-I is an application for an extension of time to file FATCA Form 8966, which is used for reporting information on foreign financial accounts. The form requires the filer to provide their name, address, taxpayer identification number, and other contact information. If the filer is a sponsored entity or intermediary, they must also provide the name and identification number of the sponsored entity or intermediary. The form also includes a section for the filer to indicate their method of filing Form 8966 (electronic or paper) and to request an additional extension if necessary. If an additional extension is requested, the filer must provide a detailed explanation for why they were unable to file by the date granted by the first extension request. The form must be signed and dated, and the filer declares under penalties of perjury that the information provided is true, correct, and complete.
