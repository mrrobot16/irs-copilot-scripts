Form 8866 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to compute interest under the look-back method for property depreciated under the income forecast method. The form requires the taxpayer to provide their identifying information, including their name, address, and taxpayer type (corporation, individual, estate or trust, S corporation, or partnership). If the taxpayer was an owner of an interest in a pass-through entity, they must also provide the name and employer identification number of the entity.

The form includes sections for the recomputation year, prior years, and adjustments to taxable income. The taxpayer must enter the taxable income (or loss) for the prior years shown on their tax return, as well as any adjustments to taxable income related to the depreciation deducted under the income forecast method. These adjustments are based on the difference between the depreciation deducted based on estimated future income and the depreciation allowable based on actual income earned before and after the recomputation year.

The form also includes sections for calculating the adjusted taxable income for look-back purposes, income tax liability, and interest due or to be refunded. The taxpayer must calculate the income tax liability on the adjusted taxable income using the tax rates in effect for the prior years. They must also determine the increase or decrease in tax for the prior years on which interest is due or to be refunded, and calculate the corresponding interest amounts.

The form requires the taxpayer to provide their signatures, under penalties of perjury, to declare the accuracy and completeness of the form. If the form is being filed separately and not with the tax return, the preparer must also provide their information and sign the form.

It is important for taxpayers to consult the instructions provided by the IRS for Form 8866 for detailed guidance on completing the form and any updates or changes to the form.
