Form 7204 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that allows taxpayers to request an extension of time to assess tax related to contested foreign income taxes. The form is used to make an election to claim a provisional foreign tax credit for the contested foreign income tax.

The form requires the taxpayer to provide their identifying information, including their name, identifying number, and social security number if applicable. The taxpayer must also provide their address.

The form includes two checkboxes to indicate the reason for filing Form 7204. The first reason is if the taxpayer claimed the foreign tax credit on the accrual basis, and the second reason is if the taxpayer claimed the foreign tax credit on the cash basis.

The form includes an agreement between the taxpayer and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The agreement states that the amount of any federal income tax due relating to the disallowance of a foreign tax credit for the contested foreign income tax may be assessed within three years from the filing date or due date of the return in which the taxpayer notifies the IRS of the resolution of the contest.

The form also includes provisions for compliance with annual notice requirements and the ability to file a claim for credit or refund within a specified period of time.

The form requires the taxpayer to provide information about the contest, including a description of the contest, the contested foreign income tax, the payor's name and identification number, the reference ID number for the contested foreign income tax, and the country or U.S. territory to which the contested foreign income tax was paid.

The form must be signed by the consenting taxpayer, and if applicable, the spouse, taxpayer's representative, and corporate officer(s).

Overall, Form 7204 is used to request an extension of time to assess tax related to contested foreign income taxes and make an election to claim a provisional foreign tax credit.
