The form begins with basic information such as the name and identifying number of the transferor and the name and EIN of the foreign partnership. It also includes a reference ID number.

The first section of the form asks whether the partnership is a section 721(c) partnership and if the gain deferral method was applied to avoid the recognition of gain upon the contribution of property.

It requires information about the type of property, the date of the original transfer, the date of disposition, the manner of disposition, the gain recognized by the partnership, the depreciation recapture recognized by the partnership, the gain allocated to the partner, and the depreciation recapture allocated to the partner.

Part III asks whether any transfers reported on the schedule are subject to gain recognition under section 904(f)(3) or section 904(f)(5)(F).

The form concludes with a space for supplemental information that may be required to be reported.
