Form 8995-A is a tax form issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers in the United States. It is used to calculate the qualified business income deduction, which is a tax deduction available to individuals who have qualified business income from a qualified trade or business, real estate investment trust dividends, publicly traded partnership income, or a domestic production activities deduction passed through from an agricultural or horticultural cooperative.

The form is divided into several parts. In Part I, taxpayers provide information about their trade, business, or aggregation, including the name, taxpayer identification number, and whether it is a specified service or aggregation. They are also required to complete Schedules A, B, and/or C before proceeding.

Part II is used to determine the adjusted qualified business income. Taxpayers calculate their qualified business income from the trade, business, or aggregation and multiply it by 20% (0.20). They also calculate their allocable share of W-2 wages and multiply it by 50% (0.50) and 25% (0.25), as well as their allocable share of the unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition (UBIA) of all qualified property and multiply it by 2.5% (0.025). The greater of the amounts calculated in lines 5 and 9 is entered on line 10.

Line 11 is used to determine the W-2 wage and UBIA of qualified property limitation, which is the smaller of line 3 or line 10. Line 12 is for the phased-in reduction, if applicable. Line 13 is the qualified business income deduction before patron reduction, which is the greater of line 11 or line 12. Line 14 is for the patron reduction, if applicable. Line 15 is the qualified business income component, calculated by subtracting line 14 from line 13. Line 16 is the total qualified business income component, which is the sum of all amounts reported on line 15.

Part III is completed if the taxpayer's taxable income is between $170,050 and $220,050 ($340,100 and $440,100 if married filing jointly) and line 10 is less than line 3. It involves calculating the phased-in reduction based on the taxpayer's taxable income before the qualified business income deduction.

Part IV is used to determine the final qualified business income deduction. Line 27 is the total qualified business income component from all qualified trades, businesses, or aggregations. Line 28 is for qualified REIT dividends and publicly traded partnership (PTP) income or loss, and line 29 is for carryforward from prior years. Line 30 is the total qualified REIT dividends and PTP income. Line 31 is the REIT and PTP component, calculated by multiplying line 30 by 20% (0.20). Line 32 is the qualified business income deduction before the income limitation, which is the sum of lines 27 and 31.

Line 33 is the taxable income before the qualified business income deduction, and line 34 is the net capital gain. Line 35 is the difference between line 33 and line 34. Line 36 is the income limitation, calculated by multiplying line 35 by 20% (0.20). Line 37 is the qualified business income deduction before the domestic production activities deduction (DPAD) under section 199A(g), which is the smaller of line 32 or line 36. Line 38 is for the DPAD allocated from an agricultural or horticultural cooperative, and line 39 is the total qualified business income deduction, calculated by adding lines 37 and 38.

Finally, line 40 is for the total qualified REIT dividends and PTP (loss) carryforward, if applicable.
