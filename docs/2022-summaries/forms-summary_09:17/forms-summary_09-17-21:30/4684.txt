Form 4684 is a document used for reporting casualties and thefts for tax purposes. It is divided into different sections depending on the type of property involved.

Section A is for reporting casualties and thefts of personal use property that is not used for business or income-producing purposes. It notes that for tax years 2018 through 2025, individuals can only deduct casualty or theft losses of personal-use property if the loss is attributable to a federally declared disaster. Separate forms are required for each casualty or theft event.

Section B is for reporting casualties and thefts of business and income-producing property. It includes a computation of gain or loss for each property and a summary of gains and losses.

Section C is for claiming a theft loss deduction for a Ponzi-type investment scheme using the procedures in Revenue Procedure 2009-20. It includes a computation of the deduction and required statements and declarations.

Section D is for electing to deduct a federally declared disaster loss in the preceding tax year or revoking a prior election. It includes the necessary information and instructions for making the election or revocation.

The form provides instructions and space for taxpayers to provide the necessary details and calculations for each section. It must be attached to the taxpayer's tax return or amended return as applicable.
