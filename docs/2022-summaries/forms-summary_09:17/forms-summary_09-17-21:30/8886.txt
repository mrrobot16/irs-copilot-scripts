Form 8886 is a Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement that taxpayers in the United States must attach to their tax return if they have participated in certain reportable transactions. The form includes various sections for taxpayers to provide information about the transaction, such as the name of the transaction, the year they participated in it, and the type of transaction it is. 

Taxpayers must also indicate if they are filing an amended tax return and check boxes that apply to their situation, such as if they are an initial year filer or if the transaction is a protective disclosure. They must also provide the tax shelter registration number if applicable. 

If the transaction is a listed transaction or a transaction of interest, taxpayers must enter the published guidance number for the transaction. They must also indicate the number of same or substantially similar transactions reported on the form. 

If the taxpayer participated in the transaction through a partnership, S corporation, trust, or foreign entity, they must check the applicable boxes and provide information about the entity, such as its type, name, and employer identification number. 

The form also requires taxpayers to provide information about any fees paid to individuals or entities related to the transaction. They must provide the name, identifying number, and address of each individual or entity and the amount of fees paid. 

In the "Facts" section of the form, taxpayers must identify the type of tax benefit generated by the transaction and enter the total dollar amount of their tax benefits. They must also indicate the anticipated number of years the transaction provides tax benefits and their total investment or basis in the transaction. 

Taxpayers must further describe the expected tax treatment and benefits generated by the transaction, including the amount and nature of their investment and any tax result protection. 

The form also requires taxpayers to identify all individuals and entities involved in the transaction that are tax-exempt, foreign, or related. They must provide their names, identifying numbers, addresses, and a brief description of their involvement. 

Additional sheets can be attached if necessary to provide all the required information.
