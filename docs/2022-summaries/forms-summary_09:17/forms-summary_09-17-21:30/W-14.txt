Form W-14 is a certificate that is used by a foreign contracting party receiving federal procurement payments to provide information to the acquiring agency. The form includes sections for identifying the foreign contracting party and the acquiring agency, as well as sections for claiming exemptions based on international agreements or procurement agreements. The form also includes an explanation section for providing additional details, and a certificate section where the foreign person or their authorized representative can sign and declare the accuracy of the information provided. The form is not to be sent to the IRS, but rather given to the acquiring agency.
