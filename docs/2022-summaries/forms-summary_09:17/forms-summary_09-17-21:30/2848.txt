Form 2848, also known as Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative, is a document used by taxpayers in the United States to appoint a representative to act on their behalf before the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The form must be completed separately for each taxpayer and is only valid for representation before the IRS.

The form consists of two parts. Part I requires the taxpayer to provide their personal information, including name, address, taxpayer identification number(s), and contact details. The taxpayer must also appoint one or more representatives, providing their names, addresses, contact information, and other relevant details. The taxpayer is required to sign and date the form on page 2, line 7.

Part II of the form is the Declaration of Representative, where the appointed representative(s) must sign and date the form. They must declare that they are not suspended or disbarred from practice before the IRS, are subject to regulations in Circular 230 governing practice before the IRS, and are authorized to represent the taxpayer for the specified matter(s). The representative must also indicate their professional designation, such as attorney, certified public accountant, enrolled agent, officer of the taxpayer organization, full-time employee, family member, enrolled actuary, unenrolled return preparer, qualifying student or law graduate, or enrolled retirement plan agent. They must provide their licensing jurisdiction and relevant license, certification, registration, or enrollment number.

The form includes sections for specifying the authorized acts of the representative(s), including receiving and inspecting confidential tax information, signing agreements or consents, accessing IRS records via an Intermediate Service Provider, authorizing disclosure to third parties, substituting or adding representatives, and signing a return. The form also allows the taxpayer to specify any specific acts that are not authorized, such as endorsing or negotiating checks issued by the government for federal tax liabilities.

The form also includes a section for the retention or revocation of prior powers of attorney, where the taxpayer can indicate whether they want to revoke any previous powers of attorney filed with the IRS. If a prior power of attorney is to remain in effect, a copy of that power of attorney must be attached to the form.

The taxpayer must sign and date the declaration section of the form, certifying that they have the legal authority to execute the form on behalf of the taxpayer. If the tax matter concerns a joint return, each spouse must file a separate power of attorney.

It is important to complete, sign, and date the form correctly, as any incomplete or unsigned forms will be returned by the IRS. The form includes instructions for completing each section and provides additional information on specific requirements and considerations.
