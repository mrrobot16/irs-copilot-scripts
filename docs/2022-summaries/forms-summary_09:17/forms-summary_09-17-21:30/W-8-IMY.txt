Form W-8IMY is a certificate used for tax withholding and reporting purposes by foreign intermediaries, foreign flow-through entities, or certain U.S. branches. The form is not to be sent to the IRS but is instead provided to the withholding agent or payer. The form provides identification information about the entity, including its name, country of incorporation or organization, and taxpayer identification number. It also requires the entity to select its chapter 3 and chapter 4 status, indicating its type of entity and whether it is subject to certain tax withholding requirements. The form includes various parts and certifications depending on the entity's status and activities, such as being a qualified intermediary, a nonqualified intermediary, a withholding foreign partnership, or a nonwithholding foreign partnership. The form also includes certifications for certain exemptions or exceptions, such as exempt retirement plans, publicly traded nonfinancial entities, and sponsored entities. The form must be signed by an authorized official of the entity, who declares that the information provided is true, correct, and complete.
