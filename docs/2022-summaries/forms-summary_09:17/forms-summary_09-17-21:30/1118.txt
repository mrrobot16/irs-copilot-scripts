Form 1118 is a tax form used by corporations in the United States to claim a foreign tax credit. The form is filed as an attachment to the corporation's tax return. The purpose of the form is to calculate the amount of foreign taxes paid or accrued by the corporation and determine the allowable foreign tax credit.

The form is divided into several schedules that capture different aspects of the foreign tax credit calculation. Schedule A is used to report the corporation's income or loss before adjustments from sources outside the United States. Schedule B is used to report the foreign taxes paid, accrued, and deemed paid by the corporation. Schedule C is used to report the tax deemed paid with respect to section 951(a)(1) inclusions by a domestic corporation. Schedule D is used to report the tax deemed paid with respect to section 951A income by a domestic corporation. Schedule E is used to report the tax deemed paid with respect to previously taxed earnings and profits (PTEP) by a domestic corporation. Schedule F is reserved for future use. Schedule G is used to report reductions of taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid. Schedule H is used to apportion certain deductions among different categories of income.

The form provides instructions and spaces for the corporation to enter relevant information, such as the corporation's name, employer identification number, and the specific categories of income and deductions being reported. The form also includes spaces for the corporation to enter information about foreign countries, currencies, and tax years.

The purpose of Form 1118 is to help corporations accurately calculate their foreign tax credit and ensure compliance with the tax laws of the United States. By claiming a foreign tax credit, corporations can offset their U.S. tax liability with taxes paid to foreign governments, thereby avoiding double taxation.
