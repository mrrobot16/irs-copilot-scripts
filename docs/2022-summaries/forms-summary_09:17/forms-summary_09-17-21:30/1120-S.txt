Form 1120-S is the U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation. It is used by S corporations to report their income, deductions, and other relevant information to the IRS. The form includes various sections and schedules where the corporation provides details about its business activity, assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and shareholder information. The form also includes schedules for reconciling income and analyzing accumulated adjustments accounts, shareholders' undistributed taxable income previously taxed, accumulated earnings and profits, and other adjustments accounts. The form must be filed if the corporation has elected to be an S corporation and meets the requirements set by the IRS.
