Schedule A (Form 8804) is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for partnerships to calculate the penalty for underpayment of estimated Section 1446 tax. The form is attached to Form 8804 and is used to determine the penalty amount, although in most cases the IRS will calculate and bill the partnership for any penalties owed.

Part I of the form lists the reasons for filing and requires the partnership to check the applicable boxes. If any boxes are checked, the partnership must file Schedule A even if no penalty is owed.

Part II of the form requires the partnership to enter the total section 1446 tax shown on their 2022 Form 8804, line 5f. If the amount is less than $500, the partnership does not owe a penalty and does not need to complete or file the form.

Part III of the form is used to calculate the underpayment. It includes columns for the installment due dates, required installments, and estimated section 1446 tax paid or credited for each period.

Part IV of the form is used if the partnership is using the adjusted seasonal installment method. It requires the partnership to enter the effectively connected taxable income (ECTI) allocable to foreign partners for specific periods.

Part V of the form is used if the partnership is using the annualized income installment method. It requires the partnership to enter the ECTI allocable to foreign partners for each annualization period.

Part VI of the form calculates the required installments based on the information provided in Part IV or Part V.

Part VII of the form is used to calculate the penalty. It includes columns for the date of payment, number of days from the due date of the installment, and the underpayment amount. The penalty is calculated based on the number of days and the applicable interest rate for each period.

The final line of the form calculates the total penalty amount, which is then entered on Form 8804, line 8.

It is important for partnerships to consult the instructions provided by the IRS for detailed guidance on completing Schedule A (Form 8804) and to ensure compliance with tax regulations.
