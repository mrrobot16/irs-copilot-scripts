Form 1040-X is used to amend a previously filed U.S. Individual Income Tax Return for the tax year 2019 or later. The form requires the taxpayer's personal information, including their name, social security number, and address. The taxpayer must indicate their filing status and provide information about their dependents. 

The form also includes sections for reporting income, deductions, and tax liability. The taxpayer must enter the original amounts reported or previously adjusted, any changes, and the correct amounts. They must also provide an explanation of the changes and attach any supporting documents.

The form includes sections for reporting payments made, including federal income tax withheld, estimated tax payments, and refundable credits. The taxpayer must calculate the total tax and subtract the payments to determine if they are owed a refund or if they owe additional tax.

The taxpayer must sign the form under penalties of perjury, declaring that the amended return is true, correct, and complete. If the taxpayer used a paid preparer, the preparer must also sign the form.

The form includes instructions and a separate page for additional explanations and information about dependents. The taxpayer should keep a copy of the form for their records.

This summary provides a general overview of the form and its sections. For specific instructions and details, taxpayers should refer to the official instructions provided by the IRS.
