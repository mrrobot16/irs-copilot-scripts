Form 8233 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for nonresident alien individuals who are receiving compensation for independent or dependent personal services in the United States. The form is used to claim a tax treaty withholding exemption for part or all of the compensation. It can also be used to claim a tax treaty withholding exemption for noncompensatory scholarship or fellowship income and personal services income from the same withholding agent.

The form includes several sections for the identification of the beneficial owner, including their name, taxpayer identification number, foreign tax identification number (if applicable), permanent residence address, and address in the United States. It also asks for information such as the U.S. visa type, country issuing passport, passport number, date of entry into the United States, and current nonimmigrant status.

Part II of the form is used to provide details of the tax treaty withholding exemption. This includes a description of the personal services being provided, the total compensation expected to be paid, the tax treaty on which the exemption is based, the treaty article on which the exemption is based, the total compensation exempt from tax under the treaty, and the country of residence.

If the individual also received compensation for personal services from the same withholding agent, they must complete lines 13a through 13d to provide information about noncompensatory scholarship or fellowship income and the tax treaty on which the exemption is based.

The form also includes a certification section where the individual declares, under penalties of perjury, that the information provided is true, correct, and complete. They also certify that they are the beneficial owner of the income, that they are not a U.S. person, and that they are a resident of the treaty country listed on the form.

The form must be signed by the beneficial owner or an individual authorized to sign on their behalf. There is also a section for the withholding agent to accept and certify the form.

Overall, Form 8233 is used by nonresident alien individuals to claim a tax treaty withholding exemption for compensation received for personal services in the United States.
