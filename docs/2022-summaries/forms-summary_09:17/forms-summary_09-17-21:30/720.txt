The form is divided into several parts, each corresponding to a different type of excise tax. Part I includes environmental taxes, domestic petroleum superfund tax, domestic petroleum oil spill tax, imported petroleum products superfund tax, imported petroleum products oil spill tax, chemicals, imported chemical substances, ozone-depleting chemicals (ODCs), and ODC tax on imported products. Part II includes taxes on communications and air transportation, fuel taxes, ship passenger tax, foreign insurance taxes, manufacturers taxes, and other excise taxes. Part III is used to calculate the total tax liability, claims for credits or refunds, deposits made, overpayments from previous quarters, and the balance due. The form also includes several schedules for reporting specific types of claims, such as nontaxable use of gasoline, kerosene used in aviation, alternative fuel credits, and other claims. Form 720-V is a payment voucher that can be used when making a payment by check or money order with Form 720.
