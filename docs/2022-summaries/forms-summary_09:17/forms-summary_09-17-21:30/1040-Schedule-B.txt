Schedule B (Form 1040) is a document provided by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to report their interest and ordinary dividends. It is to be attached to Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

The form consists of three parts. 

Part I is for reporting interest income. Taxpayers are instructed to list the name of the payer and the amount of interest received. If the interest is from a seller-financed mortgage and the property was used as a personal residence, additional instructions apply. Excludable interest on series EE and I U.S. savings bonds issued after 1989 should be reported separately by attaching Form 8815. The total interest income is calculated by adding the amounts reported.

Part II is for reporting ordinary dividends. Taxpayers are instructed to list the name of the payer and the amount of ordinary dividends received. If the dividends were reported on a Form 1099-DIV or substitute statement from a brokerage firm, the firm's name should be listed as the payer. The total amount of ordinary dividends is calculated by adding the amounts reported.

Part III is for reporting foreign accounts and trusts. Taxpayers must complete this part if they had over $1,500 of taxable interest or ordinary dividends, had a foreign account, or received a distribution from, or were a grantor of, or a transferor to, a foreign trust. There are additional requirements and potential penalties for failing to file certain forms related to foreign accounts and trusts.

The form also includes questions regarding financial interests in foreign accounts and the filing of FinCEN Form 114 (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts) and Form 3520 (Annual Return to Report Transactions with Foreign Trusts and Receipt of Certain Foreign Gifts).

Taxpayers are advised to refer to the instructions provided on the IRS website for further guidance and the most up-to-date information.
