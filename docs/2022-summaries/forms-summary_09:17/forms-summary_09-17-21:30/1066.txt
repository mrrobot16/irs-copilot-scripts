Form 1066 is the U.S. Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (REMIC) Income Tax Return for the year 2022. It is used by REMICs to report their income, deductions, and tax liability to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The form requires information such as the REMIC's name, address, employer identification number (EIN), and total assets at the end of the tax year. 

The form is divided into several sections. Section I is for the computation of taxable income or net loss, including income from interest, accrued market discount, gains or losses, and other income. Deductions such as salaries, rent, interest, taxes, depreciation, and other expenses are also reported in this section. The taxable income or net loss is calculated by subtracting the total deductions from the total income.

Section II is for the computation of tax and payments. It includes the total tax owed, tax paid with Form 7004, and the tax due or overpayment. 

Section III is for the tax on contributions made after the startup day of the REMIC. 

Section IV is for the total tax, which is the sum of the taxes calculated in Sections I, II, and III.

The form also includes additional information sections where the type of entity, number of residual interest holders, and foreign financial account information can be provided. There is also a section for balance sheets per books and a reconciliation of residual interest holders' capital accounts.

The form must be signed by the responsible party and includes a declaration of accuracy. The designation of a partnership representative is also required.
