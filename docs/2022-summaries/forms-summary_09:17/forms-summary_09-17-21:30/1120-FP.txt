Schedule P (Form 1120-F) is a document used by foreign corporations to report their interests in partnerships for tax purposes. The form is divided into several parts.

Part I requires the foreign corporation to list the partnerships it is involved in, including the name, address, and employer identification number (EIN) of each partnership. The form also asks whether the foreign corporation's distributive share of income from each partnership is effectively connected income (ECI) with a U.S. trade or business.

Part II is a summary of the foreign corporation's income and expenses from the partnerships, as reported on Schedule K-3 (Form 1065). It includes information on gross income, gross ECI, deductions and losses, and interest expenses.

Part III focuses on the foreign partners' average outside basis in the partnerships, as determined under specific regulations. It includes calculations related to section 705 outside basis, liabilities included in the outside basis, and the partners' outside basis under different regulations.

Part IV is used to report any transfers of partnership interests during the tax year. The form asks for details such as the partnership involved, the percentage interest transferred, and the dates of acquisition and transfer.

Part V deals with the gain or loss on the transfer of partnership interests. It includes calculations related to the amount realized on the transfer, the section 705 outside basis, and the outside gain or loss. It also addresses the recognition of effectively connected ordinary gain or loss, capital gain or loss, and gain or loss on U.S. real property interests.

Overall, Schedule P (Form 1120-F) provides a comprehensive overview of a foreign corporation's interests in partnerships and their tax implications.
