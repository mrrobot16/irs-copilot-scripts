Form 8872 is a report of contributions and expenditures for political organizations. The form is used to provide information about the organization, including its name, address, and contact person. It also requires the organization to specify the type of report being filed, such as a quarterly report, year-end report, or pre-election report.

The form includes two schedules: Schedule A and Schedule B. Schedule A is used to report itemized contributions, including the contributor's name, address, and occupation, as well as the amount and date of the contribution. Schedule B is used to report itemized expenditures, including the recipient's name, address, and occupation, as well as the amount and purpose of the expenditure.

The form must be signed by an authorized official of the organization, who declares under penalties of perjury that the information provided is true, correct, and complete.

The form is open to public inspection, but it warns against entering social security numbers on the form or any attachments, as they may be made public.
