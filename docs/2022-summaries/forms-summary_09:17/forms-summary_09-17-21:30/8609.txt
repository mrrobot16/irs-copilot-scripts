Form 8609 is a document used for the allocation and certification of the Low-Income Housing Credit. It is issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The form is divided into two parts.

Part I of the form is for the allocation of the credit. It includes sections for providing the address of the building, the name and address of the housing credit agency, and the name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the building owner receiving the allocation. It also requires the employer identification number of the agency and the building identification number (BIN). The form asks for the date of allocation, the maximum housing credit dollar amount allowable, and the maximum applicable credit percentage allowable. It also includes sections for the maximum qualified basis and whether the eligible basis was increased under the high-cost area provisions. Additionally, there is a section to indicate the percentage of the aggregate basis financed by tax-exempt bonds and the date the building was placed in service. Lastly, there are checkboxes to describe the allocation for the building, including whether it is newly constructed, existing, or undergoing rehabilitation, and whether it is subject to a nonprofit set-aside.

Part II of the form is for the first-year certification and is completed by building owners with respect to the first year of the credit period. It includes sections for the eligible basis of the building, the original qualified basis of the building at the close of the first year of the credit period, and whether the building is part of a multiple building project. There are also sections for making elections related to reducing eligible basis, treating large partnerships as taxpayers, meeting minimum set-aside requirements, and electing a deep rent skewed project.

The form concludes with a signature section where the authorized official of the housing credit agency and the building owner must sign, declaring that the information provided is true, correct, and complete. The form also includes spaces for the taxpayer identification number, date, and name of the signer.
