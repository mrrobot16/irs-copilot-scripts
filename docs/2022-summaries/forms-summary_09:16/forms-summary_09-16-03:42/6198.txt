Form 6198 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that taxpayers must attach to their tax return. The form is used to determine the at-risk limitations for a specific activity.

The form is divided into four parts:

Part I requires taxpayers to report the current year profit or loss from the activity, including any prior year nondeductible amounts. This includes ordinary income or loss, gains or losses from the sale of assets used in the activity, and other income and deductions related to the activity.

Part II provides a simplified computation of the amount at risk. Taxpayers must calculate the adjusted basis in the activity at the beginning of the tax year and account for any increases or decreases during the year.

Part III is a detailed computation of the amount at risk. Taxpayers must report the investment in the activity at the effective date, any increases or decreases since the effective date, and calculate the amount at risk.

Part IV determines the deductible loss. Taxpayers must compare the amount at risk with the loss reported on line 5 of the form and enter the smaller of the two as the deductible loss.

The form also includes instructions and references to other forms and publications that taxpayers may need to consult for further information.

It is important for taxpayers to complete Form 6198 accurately to determine the limitations on deducting losses from the activity and to comply with IRS regulations.
