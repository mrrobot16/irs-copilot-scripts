Form 8606 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for individuals to report nondeductible contributions to traditional Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and distributions from traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs. The form is used to calculate the taxable and nontaxable portions of these contributions and distributions.

The form is divided into three parts:

Part I: Nondeductible Contributions to Traditional IRAs and Distributions From Traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs
- This part is completed if the individual made nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA in the tax year or took distributions from a traditional, SEP, or SIMPLE IRA and made nondeductible contributions in the same or previous years.
- The individual is required to enter the amount of nondeductible contributions made for the tax year and the total basis in traditional IRAs.
- The form provides instructions on how to calculate the total basis and the taxable and nontaxable portions of distributions.

Part II: Conversions From Traditional, SEP, or SIMPLE IRAs to Roth IRAs
- This part is completed if the individual converted part or all of their traditional, SEP, or SIMPLE IRAs to a Roth IRA in the tax year.
- The individual is required to enter the amount of the conversion and the basis in the converted amount.
- The form provides instructions on how to calculate the taxable amount of the conversion.

Part III: Distributions From Roth IRAs
- This part is completed if the individual took a distribution from a Roth IRA in the tax year.
- The individual is required to enter the total nonqualified distributions from Roth IRAs, including any qualified first-time homebuyer distributions.
- The form provides instructions on how to calculate the taxable amount of the distribution.

The form also includes sections for the individual's personal information, such as name, address, and social security number, as well as spaces for signatures and preparer information if applicable.

Form 8606 is to be attached to the individual's Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR when filing their tax return.
