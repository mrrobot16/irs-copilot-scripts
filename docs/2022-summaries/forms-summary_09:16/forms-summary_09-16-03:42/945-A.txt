Form 945-A is an annual record of federal tax liability for taxpayers who are semiweekly schedule depositors or who have accumulated tax liability of $100,000 or more in any month. The form requires taxpayers to report their tax liability for each month of the year. The form is filed along with Form 945, 945-X, CT-1, CT-1 X, 944, or 944-X. Taxpayers must report their tax liability for each month separately, and the total tax liability for the year must match the amount reported on Form 945, Form CT-1, or Form 944. The form includes instructions and a section for taxpayers to enter their name and employer identification number.
