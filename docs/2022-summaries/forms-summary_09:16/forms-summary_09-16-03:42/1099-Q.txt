Form 1099-Q is a tax form used to report payments made from qualified education programs under sections 529 and 530 of the Internal Revenue Code. The form is divided into three copies: Copy A is filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Copy B is provided to the recipient, and Copy C is for the payer's records.

The form requires the payer/trustee's name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN), as well as the recipient's name, address, and TIN. It also includes an account number.

The form includes several boxes to report information about the distribution, including the gross distribution amount, earnings, basis, and whether there was a trustee-to-trustee transfer. It also indicates whether the distribution is from a qualified tuition program or a Coverdell ESA, and whether the recipient is the designated beneficiary.

The form provides instructions for the recipient on how to determine the taxability of the distribution and references other publications and forms for more information. It also includes a reminder that failure to report taxable income may result in penalties or sanctions.

The instructions for the payer/trustee indicate that they should use the current General Instructions for Certain Information Returns and the Instructions for Form 1099-Q to complete the form. The instructions also provide information on filing and furnishing the form, including electronic filing options and contact information for assistance.
