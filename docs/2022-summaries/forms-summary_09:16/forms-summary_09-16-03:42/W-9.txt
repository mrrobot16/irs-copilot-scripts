Form W-9 is a document used by individuals or entities to provide their taxpayer identification number (TIN) to the IRS. The form includes sections for the individual or entity to enter their name, business name (if applicable), federal tax classification, exemptions, address, and TIN. The form also includes a certification section where the individual or entity certifies that the information provided is correct and that they are a U.S. citizen or other U.S. person. The form provides instructions for completing each section and includes information on penalties for failing to provide a TIN or providing false information. The form is used by the IRS to obtain TINs for reporting purposes, such as reporting income, dividends, or other payments made to the individual or entity.
