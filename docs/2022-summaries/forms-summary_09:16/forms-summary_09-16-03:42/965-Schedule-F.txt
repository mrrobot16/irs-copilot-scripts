Schedule F (Form 965) is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for foreign corporations that have a section 965(a) inclusion during their 2020 tax year. It is used to report foreign taxes deemed paid by a domestic corporation. The form requires the filer to provide information such as the name and identifying number of the person filing the return, the name and identification numbers of the foreign corporation and K-1 issuer (if applicable), the U.S. tax year end of the deferred foreign income corporation (DFIC), the country of incorporation, and the section 965(a) inclusion in U.S. dollars and functional currency.

The form also includes sections to report post-1986 undistributed earnings in functional currency, divide the section 965(a) inclusion by the post-1986 undistributed earnings (capped at 100%), and calculate the opening balance in post-1986 foreign income taxes, foreign taxes paid for the tax year indicated, foreign taxes deemed paid for the tax year indicated, post-1986 foreign income taxes, and taxes deemed paid (multiplied by the division of the section 965(a) inclusion and post-1986 undistributed earnings).

The form provides space for additional schedules if needed. The filer is directed to visit the IRS website for instructions and the latest information on Form 965. The form includes a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice.
