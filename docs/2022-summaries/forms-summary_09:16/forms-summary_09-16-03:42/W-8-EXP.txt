Form W-8EXP is a certificate used by foreign governments, international organizations, foreign central banks of issue, foreign tax-exempt organizations, foreign private foundations, and governments of U.S. possessions for United States tax withholding and reporting purposes. This form is not to be sent to the IRS but is to be given to the withholding agent or payer. The form includes sections for the identification of the beneficial owner, qualification statements for Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 status, and a certification section. The form requires the organization to provide information such as its name, country of incorporation or organization, type of entity, permanent and mailing addresses, U.S. taxpayer identification number (if required), and reference numbers. Depending on the type of organization, different qualification statements need to be completed to certify the organization's eligibility for certain tax exemptions or benefits. The form also includes a certification section where an authorized official of the organization must sign and date the form.
