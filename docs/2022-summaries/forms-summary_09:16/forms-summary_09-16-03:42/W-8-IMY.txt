Form W-8IMY is a certificate used by foreign intermediaries, foreign flow-through entities, or certain U.S. branches to claim tax withholding and reporting status with the IRS. This form is not to be sent to the IRS but provided to the withholding agent or payer. The form includes various sections for identifying the entity, determining its chapter 3 and chapter 4 status, and providing certifications related to its activities and compliance with tax regulations. The form also includes certifications for qualified intermediaries, nonqualified intermediaries, withholding foreign partnerships, withholding foreign trusts, nonwithholding foreign partnerships, nonwithholding foreign trusts, and other types of entities. The form ends with a certification statement signed by an authorized official.
