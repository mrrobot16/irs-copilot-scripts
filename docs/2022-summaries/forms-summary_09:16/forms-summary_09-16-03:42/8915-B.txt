Form 8915-B is a document issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used to report qualified 2017 disaster retirement plan distributions and repayments. The form is to be attached to the taxpayer's 2021 Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form consists of two parts: Part I for qualified 2017 disaster distributions from retirement plans other than IRAs, and Part II for qualified 2017 disaster distributions from traditional, SEP, SIMPLE, and Roth IRAs.

In Part I, taxpayers are required to enter the amount from their 2020 Form 8915-B, line 6 and line 1. They also need to calculate their excess repayment from 2020 by subtracting line 1b from line 1a. The form provides space to report any repayments made in 2021 that were not included on the 2020 form.

Part II follows a similar format for qualified 2017 disaster distributions from IRAs. Taxpayers need to enter the amounts from their 2020 Form 8915-B, line 13 and line 8. They also need to calculate their excess repayment from 2020 and report any repayments made in 2021.

The form includes a signature section where the taxpayer can sign if filing the form separately from their tax return. There is also a section for paid preparers to provide their information.

The form includes instructions and a link to the IRS website for additional information. It is important for taxpayers to consult the instructions and refer to the latest information provided by the IRS when completing the form.
