Form 3800 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used to calculate and claim the General Business Credit on a tax return. The form consists of three parts.

Part I is used to calculate the current year credit for credits not allowed against the Tentative Minimum Tax (TMT). It requires the taxpayer to enter the general business credit and passive activity credits from all Parts III of the form. It also includes sections for the carryforward and carryback of the general business credit.

Part II is used to calculate the allowable credit. It requires the taxpayer to enter the regular tax before credits and alternative minimum tax. The form provides instructions on where to find these amounts depending on the type of taxpayer (individual, corporation, or estate/trust).

Part III is used to report specific credits that contribute to the General Business Credit. The taxpayer must complete a separate Part III for each type of credit being claimed. The form provides a list of credits, such as investment credit, research activities credit, low-income housing credit, and many others. The taxpayer must enter the description of the credit, the amount, and any additional information required.

Once all parts of the form are completed, the taxpayer can calculate the total allowable credit by adding the amounts from Part II and Part III. The final amount is then reported on the applicable line of the tax return.

It is important for taxpayers to consult the instructions provided with the form for detailed guidance on how to complete and file Form 3800.
