Form 8996 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers who are organized as corporations or partnerships and are investing in qualified opportunity zone (QOZ) property. The form is used to calculate the investment standard and determine if the taxpayer has met the requirements for maintaining the investment standard.

The form is divided into several parts:

Part I: General Information and Certification
- Taxpayers indicate their type (corporation or partnership) and whether they are organized for the purpose of investing in QOZ property.
- If it is the taxpayer's first period as a QOF (Qualified Opportunity Fund), they provide information about the entity's purpose and description of the trade or business engaged in.

Part II: Investment Standard Calculation
- Taxpayers enter the total QOZ property held on the last day of the first 6-month period and the total assets held on that day.
- They also enter the total QOZ property held on the last day of the tax year and the total assets held on that day.
- The form calculates the ratio of QOZ property to total assets.

Part III: Qualified Opportunity Fund Average and Penalty
- The form adds the ratios calculated in Part II and divides the sum by 2.0.
- If the result is equal to or more than 0.90, taxpayers enter zero on this line and file the form with their tax return.
- If the result is less than 0.90, taxpayers have failed to maintain the investment standard and need to complete Part IV to calculate the penalty.

Part IV: Line 15 Penalty
- Taxpayers who failed to maintain the investment standard complete this part to calculate the penalty.
- The form provides a table for taxpayers to enter total assets and QOZ property values for each month of the tax year.
- The form calculates the penalty based on the underpayment rate and the difference between the QOZ property value and 90% of the total assets.

Part V: QOZ Business Property Directly Owned or Leased by Taxpayer
- Taxpayers enter information about QOZs where their directly owned or leased QOZ business property is located.

Part VI: QOZ Stock or Partnership Interests
- Taxpayers enter information about QOZ businesses in which they hold stock or partnership interests.
- They provide the value of the QOZ stock or partnership interest held on the last day of the first 6-month period and the last day of the tax year.
- They also provide information about tangible property held by the QOZ business.

Part VII: QOZ Stock or Partnership Interests (continued)
- If taxpayers have invested in QOZ businesses with locations in additional QOZs, they can provide that information here.

The form also includes instructions and references to additional guidance on the IRS website.
