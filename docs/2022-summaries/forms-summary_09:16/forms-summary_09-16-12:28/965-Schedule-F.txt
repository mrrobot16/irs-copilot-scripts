Schedule F (Form 965) is a form provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for domestic corporations to report foreign taxes deemed paid. This form is specifically for foreign corporations in which the filer has a section 965(a) inclusion during its 2020 tax year. 

The form requires the filer to provide the name of the person filing the return, their identifying number, and a separate category code. If code 901j is entered, the filer must also enter the country code for the sanctioned country. 

The form also requires information about the Deferred Foreign Income Corporation (DFIC) including its EIN or reference ID number, the EIN or reference ID number of the K-1 issuer (if any), the U.S. tax year end of the DFIC, and the country of incorporation. 

Columns (e)(1) and (e)(2) require the filer to report the section 965(a) inclusion in U.S. dollars and in the functional currency. 

The form also includes columns for reporting post-1986 undistributed earnings in functional currency, dividing column (e)(2) by column (f), opening balance in post-1986 foreign income taxes, foreign taxes paid for the indicated tax year, foreign taxes deemed paid for the indicated tax year, post-1986 foreign income taxes, and taxes deemed paid (which is the result of multiplying column (g) by column (k)).

Additional schedules can be added as needed. The form includes a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice as well.
