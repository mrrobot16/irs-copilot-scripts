Form 1120-SF is the U.S. Income Tax Return for Settlement Funds, specifically for funds established under Section 468B of the Internal Revenue Code. This form is used to report income, deductions, and tax liability for settlement funds. 

The form requires the fund administrator to provide information such as the name and identification number of the fund, address, and contact details. The administrator must also indicate if it is the final return, if there have been any name or address changes, or if it is an amended return.

Part I of the form requires the reporting of income and deductions. This includes taxable interest, dividends, capital gain net income, income or gain from a partnership interest, and other income. Deductions include trustee/administrator fees, taxes, accounting and legal services, notification of claimants and claim processing expenses, and other deductions. The net operating loss deduction is also included.

Part II is for tax computation. It calculates the modified gross income by subtracting total deductions from gross income. The total tax is then determined by multiplying the modified gross income by the applicable tax rate. The form also provides sections for credits and payments, estimated tax penalty, and the amount of tax due or overpaid.

The second page of the form includes Schedule L, which is used to report the balance sheets of the fund. It requires information on assets, liabilities, and fund balance.

Additional information is also requested, such as the amount of cash and property transferred to the fund during the tax year, tax-exempt interest received or accrued, distributions made to claimants, distributions made to transferors or related parties, the type of liability for which the fund was established, and the court order number under which the fund was established.

The form must be signed by the fund administrator under penalties of perjury, declaring that the return is true, correct, and complete. There is also a section for the preparer's information, including their name, signature, and PTIN (Preparer Tax Identification Number).

The form includes instructions and a website link for additional information.
