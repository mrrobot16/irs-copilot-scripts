Form 8995 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim the qualified business income deduction. This deduction can be claimed if the taxpayer has qualified business income from a qualified trade or business, real estate investment trust dividends, publicly traded partnership income, or a domestic production activities deduction passed through from an agricultural or horticultural cooperative.

The form is used by taxpayers whose taxable income, before the qualified business income deduction, is at or below $170,050 ($340,100 if married filing jointly), and who are not patrons of an agricultural or horticultural cooperative.

The form includes various sections for taxpayers to report their qualified business income or loss, qualified business net loss carryforward from the prior year, total qualified business income, qualified business income component, qualified REIT dividends and publicly traded partnership income or loss, qualified REIT dividends and qualified PTP loss carryforward from the prior year, total qualified REIT dividends and PTP income, REIT and PTP component, qualified business income deduction before the income limitation, taxable income before qualified business income deduction, net capital gain, income limitation, and the final qualified business income deduction amount.

The form also includes sections for taxpayers to report any carryforwards of qualified business losses and qualified REIT dividends and PTP losses from previous years.

Taxpayers are instructed to attach Form 8995 to their tax return and can find detailed instructions and the latest information on the IRS website.
