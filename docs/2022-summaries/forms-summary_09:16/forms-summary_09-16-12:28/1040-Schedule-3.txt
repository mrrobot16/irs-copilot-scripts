Schedule 3 (Form 1040) is an attachment to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR that taxpayers can use to report additional credits and payments on their tax return. The form is divided into two parts.

Part I is for reporting nonrefundable credits. It includes various credits such as the foreign tax credit, child and dependent care expenses credit, education credits, retirement savings contributions credit, residential energy credits, and other nonrefundable credits. Taxpayers need to attach the relevant forms for each credit they are claiming.

Part II is for reporting other payments and refundable credits. It includes the net premium tax credit, amount paid with a request for an extension to file, excess social security and tier 1 RRTA tax withheld, credit for federal tax on fuels, and other payments or refundable credits. Taxpayers may also need to attach additional forms for certain credits.

Once the amounts for nonrefundable credits and other payments/refundable credits are calculated, taxpayers can add them together and enter the total on the appropriate line of their Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

This summary provides a general overview of Schedule 3 (Form 1040) and its purpose. For specific instructions and the latest information, taxpayers should refer to the official IRS website or consult with a tax professional.
