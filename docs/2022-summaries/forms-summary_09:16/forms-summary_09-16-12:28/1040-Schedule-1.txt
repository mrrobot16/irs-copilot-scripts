Schedule 1 (Form 1040) is a document used to report additional income and adjustments to income on a taxpayer's federal tax return. It is attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. The form is divided into two parts.

Part I, Additional Income, includes various sources of additional income that must be reported on the tax return. This includes taxable refunds, credits, or offsets of state and local income taxes, alimony received, business income or loss, other gains or losses, rental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, farm income or loss, unemployment compensation, and other types of income such as net operating loss, gambling winnings, cancellation of debt, foreign earned income exclusion, and more. Taxpayers must provide the necessary information and attach any required supporting schedules or forms.

Part II, Adjustments to Income, allows taxpayers to report adjustments that can reduce their taxable income. This includes deductions for educator expenses, certain business expenses of reservists, performing artists, and fee-basis government officials, health savings account deduction, moving expenses for members of the Armed Forces, deductible part of self-employment tax, self-employed retirement plans, self-employed health insurance deduction, penalty on early withdrawal of savings, alimony paid, IRA deduction, student loan interest deduction, and other adjustments related to jury duty pay, rental of personal property, Olympic and Paralympic medals and USOC prize money, reforestation amortization and expenses, repayment of supplemental unemployment benefits, contributions to certain pension plans, attorney fees and court costs, and more.

Taxpayers are required to calculate the total additional income and adjustments to income and enter the respective totals on the appropriate lines of their Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR tax return.

It's important for taxpayers to consult the instructions provided by the IRS for more detailed information and guidance on completing Schedule 1.
