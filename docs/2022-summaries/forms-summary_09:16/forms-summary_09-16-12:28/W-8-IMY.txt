Form W-8IMY is a certificate used by foreign intermediaries, foreign flow-through entities, or certain U.S. branches to certify their status for tax withholding and reporting purposes in the United States. The form includes various sections where the entity provides information about its identification, chapter 3 and chapter 4 status, and other relevant details. The form also includes certifications related to qualified intermediaries, nonqualified intermediaries, withholding foreign partnerships, withholding foreign trusts, nonwithholding foreign partnerships, nonwithholding foreign simple trusts, nonwithholding foreign grantor trusts, and other types of entities. The form must be signed by an authorized official of the entity and is used to provide information to the withholding agent or payer, not to the IRS.
