Form 3520-A is an Annual Information Return that must be filed by foreign trusts with a U.S. owner. The form is used to report general information about the foreign trust, such as its name, address, and creation date. It also includes sections for reporting whether a U.S. agent has been appointed, and if not, the trust documents must be attached.

The form also includes sections for reporting the foreign trust's income and expenses, as well as its balance sheet. The income section requires reporting of various types of income, such as interest, dividends, rents, and royalties. The expenses section includes items such as interest expense, taxes, and trustee fees. The balance sheet section requires reporting of the trust's assets and liabilities.

Additionally, the form includes separate statements for foreign grantor trust owners and beneficiaries. These statements require reporting of specific information related to the U.S. owner or beneficiary, including their name, address, and taxpayer identification number. The statements also require reporting of any distributions received from the trust and any income attributable to the U.S. owner or beneficiary.

The form must be signed under penalties of perjury by the trustees or U.S. owners, and it is important to ensure that all information provided is true, correct, and complete.
