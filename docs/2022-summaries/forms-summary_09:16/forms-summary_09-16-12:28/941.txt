Form 941 is the Employers Quarterly Federal Tax Return used by employers in the United States to report wages, tips, and other compensation paid to employees, as well as the federal income tax withheld from those payments. The form is divided into several parts.

Part 1 of the form asks employers to answer questions about the number of employees who received wages, tips, or other compensation for the quarter and the total amount of wages, tips, and other compensation paid.

Part 2 of the form is for employers to provide information about their deposit schedule and tax liability for the quarter.

Part 3 of the form asks employers to provide information about their business, including whether the business has closed or stopped paying wages, and if they are a seasonal employer.

Part 4 of the form asks employers if they want to allow a third-party designee to discuss the return with the IRS.

Part 5 of the form is for the employer to sign and declare that the information provided on the form is true, correct, and complete.

The form also includes a payment voucher, Form 941-V, which employers can use to make a payment with their Form 941. The voucher includes instructions for completing and submitting the payment.

The form includes a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, which explains the purpose of the form and the requirements for providing the requested information. It also provides estimated average times for completing the form and invites employers to provide comments or suggestions for making the form simpler.

Employers must complete all three pages of Form 941 and sign it. The completed form should be submitted to the IRS along with any required payment.
