Form 8821 is a Tax Information Authorization form issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. The form is used to authorize a designated individual or entity to access and receive confidential tax information on behalf of the taxpayer. 

The form consists of several sections:

1. Taxpayer Information: The taxpayer must provide their name, address, taxpayer identification number(s), daytime telephone number, and plan number (if applicable). The taxpayer must also sign and date the form on line 6.

2. Designee(s): The taxpayer can name up to two designees to receive tax information. If more than two designees are required, an additional list can be attached. The designee's name, address, telephone number, fax number, and other contact details should be provided. The taxpayer can also indicate if the designee should receive copies of notices and communications.

3. Tax Information: The taxpayer must specify the type of tax information (e.g., income, employment, payroll, etc.), tax form number (e.g., 1040, 941, 720, etc.), year(s) or period(s) of the tax information, and specific tax matters for which the designee is authorized to access the information. The taxpayer can also authorize access to their IRS records via an Intermediate Service Provider.

4. Specific Use: If the tax information authorization is for a specific use not recorded on the Centralized Authorization File (CAF), the taxpayer should check this box and follow the instructions.

5. Retention/Revocation of Prior Authorizations: If the taxpayer checked the box on line 4 for a specific use not recorded on the CAF, they should skip this line. Otherwise, the IRS will automatically revoke all prior tax information authorizations on file unless the taxpayer checks the line 5 box and attaches a copy of the tax information authorization(s) they want to retain.

6. Taxpayer Signature: The taxpayer or their authorized representative must sign, date, and print their name on this line. If the form is signed by someone other than the taxpayer, that person must have the legal authority to execute the form for the specified tax matters and periods.

It is important to note that Form 8821 should not be used to request copies of tax returns or to authorize someone to represent the taxpayer. The form is solely for authorizing access to tax information.
