Form 8941 is a document issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used to claim the Credit for Small Employer Health Insurance Premiums. The form must be attached to the taxpayer's tax return.

The form consists of multiple sections and requires the taxpayer to provide various information. Here is a summary of the key sections:
