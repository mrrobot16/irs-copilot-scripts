Schedule M-3 is a form that must be attached to Form 1120-PC, which is used by U.S. property and casualty insurance companies with total assets of $10 million or more. The purpose of Schedule M-3 is to reconcile the net income (loss) reported on the company's financial statements with the taxable income reported on its tax return.

The form is divided into three parts. 

Part I requires the company to provide financial information and reconcile its net income (loss) per its income statement with its taxable income. The company must indicate whether it filed SEC Form 10-K for the income statement period and whether it prepared a certified audited non-tax-basis income statement. If not, the company must provide its net income (loss) per its books and records.

Part II focuses on the reconciliation of net income (loss) per the income statement with taxable income per the tax return. The company must provide details of various income and loss items and indicate whether there are any temporary or permanent differences between the income statement and tax return.

Part III deals with the reconciliation of expense and deduction items. The company must provide details of various expense and deduction items and indicate whether there are any temporary or permanent differences between the income statement and tax return.

The form also includes sections for reporting the total amount of assets and liabilities included or removed in the reconciliation process.

Overall, Schedule M-3 is a detailed form that helps insurance companies reconcile their financial statements with their tax returns, ensuring compliance with tax regulations.
