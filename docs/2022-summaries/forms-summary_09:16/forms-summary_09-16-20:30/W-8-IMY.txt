Form W-8IMY is a certificate used by foreign intermediaries, foreign flow-through entities, or certain U.S. branches to claim exemptions or reductions from U.S. tax withholding and reporting. The form is not to be sent to the IRS but rather provided to the withholding agent or payer. It includes various sections where the entity can indicate its status, such as whether it is a qualified intermediary, nonqualified intermediary, withholding foreign partnership, withholding foreign trust, nonwithholding foreign partnership, nonwithholding foreign simple trust, nonwithholding foreign grantor trust, or other types of entities. The form also includes sections for identifying the entity, providing its address, taxpayer identification number, and other relevant information. The form must be signed by an authorized official of the entity, and the official declares under penalties of perjury that the information provided is true, correct, and complete.
