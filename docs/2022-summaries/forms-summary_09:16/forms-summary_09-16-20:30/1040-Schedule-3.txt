Schedule 3 (Form 1040) is an attachment to the individual tax return form used in the United States, specifically Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. It is used to report additional credits and payments that the taxpayer may be eligible for. 

Part I of Schedule 3 is for reporting nonrefundable credits, such as the foreign tax credit, child and dependent care expenses credit, education credits, retirement savings contributions credit, residential energy credits, and other nonrefundable credits.

Part II of Schedule 3 is for reporting other payments and refundable credits, including the net premium tax credit, amount paid with a request for an extension to file, excess social security and tier 1 RRTA tax withheld, credit for federal tax on fuels, and other payments or refundable credits.

The taxpayer must fill out the appropriate sections of Schedule 3 and attach any necessary forms or documentation to support their claims for credits and payments. The total amounts from both parts of Schedule 3 are then transferred to the appropriate lines on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

It is important for taxpayers to consult the instructions provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and visit the IRS website (www.irs.gov/Form1040) for the most up-to-date information and guidance on completing Schedule 3.
