Form 941 is the Employers Quarterly Federal Tax Return used by employers in the United States to report wages, tips, and other compensation, as well as federal income tax withheld from employees' wages. The form is divided into several parts, with Part 1 containing questions about the number of employees, wages, and tax withheld for the quarter. Part 2 asks about the deposit schedule and tax liability for the quarter. Part 3 collects information about the business, including whether it has closed or stopped paying wages. Part 4 allows for the designation of a third-party representative to discuss the return with the IRS. Finally, Part 5 is where the form must be signed by the employer. The form also includes a payment voucher, Form 941-V, to be used when making a payment with Form 941. The form includes a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, explaining the purpose of the form and the confidentiality of the information provided.
