Form 1125-E is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used to report the compensation of officers for businesses that have total receipts of $500,000 or more. The form must be attached to Form 1120, 1120-C, 1120-F, 1120-REIT, 1120-RIC, or 1120S.

The form requires the following information to be provided for each officer:
- Name
- Social security number
- Percentage of time devoted to the business
- Percentage of stock owned
- Amount of compensation

The form also includes lines to calculate the total compensation of officers and to subtract any compensation claimed on Form 1125-A or elsewhere on the tax return. The final result is entered on Form 1120, page 1, line 12 or the appropriate line of the tax return.

The form includes an OMB number for paperwork reduction act notice, and more information about Form 1125-E can be found on the IRS website.
