Form W-8EXP is a certificate issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for foreign governments, international organizations, foreign tax-exempt organizations, foreign private foundations, and governments of U.S. possessions. This form is used for United States tax withholding and reporting purposes. It is not to be sent to the IRS, but rather given to the withholding agent or payer.

The form provides instructions on which form to use for different types of entities and situations. It includes sections for the identification of the beneficial owner, qualification statement for Chapter 3 status (for foreign governments, international organizations, and foreign central banks of issue), qualification statement for Chapter 4 status (if required), and a certification section.

The form requires the organization's name, country of incorporation or organization, type of entity, permanent and mailing addresses, U.S. Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN), reference numbers, and other relevant information. It also includes checkboxes for different chapter statuses, such as participating FFI, reporting model FFI, exempt retirement plan, and more.

The form must be signed by an authorized official of the organization, who certifies that the information provided is true, correct, and complete. The official also agrees to submit a new form if any certification becomes incorrect.

Overall, Form W-8EXP is used to establish the foreign entity's status for tax withholding and reporting purposes in the United States.
