Form W-9 is a document used by individuals or entities in the United States to provide their taxpayer identification number (TIN) to the IRS. The form requests information such as the name of the taxpayer, business name (if applicable), federal tax classification, exemptions (if any), address, and TIN. The form also includes a certification section where the taxpayer certifies their TIN, exemption from backup withholding, U.S. citizenship or residency, and correct FATCA code (if applicable). The form provides instructions and guidelines for completing each section. The purpose of the form is to ensure accurate reporting of income and to prevent backup withholding.
