Schedule 1 (Form 1040) is a document that individuals must attach to their Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR when filing their taxes in the United States. It contains two parts: Additional Income and Adjustments to Income.

Part I, Additional Income, provides space to report various types of income that are not typically reported on the main tax form. This includes taxable refunds, credits, or offsets of state and local income taxes, alimony received, business income or loss, other gains or losses, rental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, farm income or loss, unemployment compensation, and other types of income such as net operating loss, gambling winnings, cancellation of debt, foreign earned income exclusion, income from certain forms (Form 8853 and Form 8889), Alaska Permanent Fund dividends, jury duty pay, prizes and awards, activity not engaged in for profit income, stock options, income from the rental of personal property, Olympic and Paralympic medals and USOC prize money, Section 951(a) inclusion, Section 951A(a) inclusion, Section 461(l) excess business loss adjustment, taxable distributions from an ABLE account, scholarship and fellowship grants, nontaxable amount of Medicaid waiver payments, pension or annuity from a nonqualified deferred compensation plan or a nongovernmental section 457 plan, and wages earned while incarcerated. There is also a space to list any other income not specifically mentioned.

Part II, Adjustments to Income, allows individuals to report various deductions and adjustments that can reduce their taxable income. This includes educator expenses, certain business expenses of reservists, performing artists, and fee-basis government officials, health savings account deduction, moving expenses for members of the Armed Forces, deductible part of self-employment tax, self-employed SEP, SIMPLE, and qualified plans, self-employed health insurance deduction, penalty on early withdrawal of savings, alimony paid, IRA deduction, student loan interest deduction, Archer MSA deduction, and other adjustments such as jury duty pay, deductible expenses related to income reported on line 8l, nontaxable amount of the value of Olympic and Paralympic medals and USOC prize money, reforestation amortization and expenses, repayment of supplemental unemployment benefits under the Trade Act of 1974, contributions to section 501(c)(18)(D) pension plans, contributions by certain chaplains to section 403(b) plans, attorney fees and court costs for actions involving certain unlawful discrimination claims, attorney fees and court costs paid in connection with an award from the IRS for information provided that helped the IRS detect tax law violations, housing deduction from Form 2555, excess deductions of section 67(e) expenses from Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), and any other adjustments not specifically mentioned.

The totals from Part I and Part II are then transferred to the appropriate lines on the main tax form (Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR) to calculate the individual's total income and taxable income.
