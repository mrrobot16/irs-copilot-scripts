Form 8915-B is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to report qualified 2017 disaster retirement plan distributions and repayments. The form is to be attached to the taxpayer's 2021 Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form consists of two parts: Part I is for reporting qualified 2017 disaster distributions from retirement plans other than IRAs, and Part II is for reporting qualified 2017 disaster distributions from traditional, SEP, SIMPLE, and Roth IRAs.

In Part I, taxpayers are required to enter the amount from their 2020 Form 8915-B, line 6 and line 1, and calculate their excess repayment from 2020. They also need to report any repayments made in 2021 that were not included on their 2020 Form 8915-B. The total amount of repayments made in 2021 can be carried back to reduce the amount subject to tax in a prior year.

Similarly, in Part II, taxpayers are required to enter the amount from their 2020 Form 8915-B, line 13 and line 8, and calculate their excess repayment from 2020. They also need to report any repayments made in 2021 that were not included on their 2020 Form 8915-B. The total amount of repayments made in 2021 can be carried back to reduce the amount subject to tax in a prior year.

The form also includes space for the taxpayer's name, social security number, address, and signature. It is important to note that this form should only be filed separately if not being filed with the taxpayer's tax return.
