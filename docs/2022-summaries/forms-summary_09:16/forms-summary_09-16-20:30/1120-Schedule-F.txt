Form 1120-SF is the U.S. Income Tax Return for Settlement Funds under Section 468B. This form is used to report the income and deductions of settlement funds for tax purposes. The form consists of two parts: Part I, which reports the income and deductions of the fund, and Part II, which calculates the tax liability.

In Part I, the form asks for various types of income, such as taxable interest, dividends, capital gains, and income from a partnership interest. It also allows for reporting other types of income and requires the total gross income to be calculated by adding all the income reported.

Deductions are also reported in Part I, including trustee/administrator fees, taxes, accounting and legal services, and other deductions. The net operating loss deduction is also included. The total deductions are calculated by adding all the deductions reported.

In Part II, the form calculates the modified gross income by subtracting the total deductions from the gross income. The total tax is then calculated by multiplying the modified gross income by 37%. The form also includes sections for reporting credits and payments, estimated tax penalties, and the amount of tax due or overpaid.

The form also includes a Schedule L, which is used to report the balance sheet of the settlement fund, including assets, liabilities, and fund balance. Additional information is also requested, such as the amount of cash and property transferred to the fund, any tax-exempt interest received, and any distributions made to claimants or transferors.

The form must be signed by the fund administrator under penalties of perjury, and there is a section for the preparer's information if applicable.

Overall, Form 1120-SF is used to report the income, deductions, and tax liability of settlement funds for tax purposes.
