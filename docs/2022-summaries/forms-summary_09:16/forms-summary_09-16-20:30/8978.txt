Form 8978 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for partners to report additional taxes for a specific tax year. The form includes three parts: Part I focuses on the computation of additional reporting year tax, Part II deals with penalties, and Part III covers interest. 

In Part I, partners are required to provide information about the tax years ended in the specific tax year being reported. They must report the total income per the original return or as previously adjusted, and any adjustments to income from Schedule A. The corrected income is calculated by combining these amounts. Similarly, partners must report the total deductions per the original return or as previously adjusted, adjustments to deductions from Schedule A, and calculate the corrected deductions. The corrected taxable income is then derived by subtracting the corrected deductions from the corrected income. Partners must also determine the income tax and alternative minimum tax on the corrected taxable income, and calculate the total corrected income tax by adding these amounts together. Additionally, they must report the total credits per the original return or as previously adjusted, adjustments to credits from Schedule A, and calculate the corrected credits. The total corrected income tax liability is determined by subtracting the corrected credits from the total corrected income tax. Finally, partners must report the total income tax shown on the original return or as previously adjusted, calculate the increase or decrease to tax by subtracting the total income tax shown on the original return from the total corrected income tax liability, and calculate the total increase or decrease to reporting year tax by adding these amounts.

Part II of the form focuses on penalties. Partners must report any penalties incurred and calculate the total penalties by adding them together.

Part III covers interest. Partners must report any interest accrued and calculate the total interest by adding the amounts together.

The form includes instructions for completing each section and directs users to the IRS website for additional information and the latest updates.
