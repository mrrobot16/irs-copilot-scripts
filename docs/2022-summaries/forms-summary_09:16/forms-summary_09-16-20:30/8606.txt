Form 8606 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used to report information related to nondeductible Individual Retirement Account (IRA) contributions, distributions from traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs, and conversions from traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs to Roth IRAs.

The form is divided into three parts:

Part I: Nondeductible Contributions to Traditional IRAs and Distributions From Traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs. This part is completed if the taxpayer made nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA for the tax year, took distributions from a traditional, SEP, or SIMPLE IRA and made nondeductible contributions, or converted part of their traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs to Roth IRAs and made nondeductible contributions. The taxpayer must enter the amount of their nondeductible contributions, their total basis in traditional IRAs, and calculate the sum of these amounts.

Part II: 2022 Conversions From Traditional, SEP, or SIMPLE IRAs to Roth IRAs. This part is completed if the taxpayer converted part or all of their traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs to a Roth IRA in the tax year. The taxpayer must enter the amount of their conversions and calculate the taxable amount.

Part III: Distributions From Roth IRAs. This part is completed if the taxpayer took a distribution from a Roth IRA in the tax year. The taxpayer must enter their total nonqualified distributions from Roth IRAs and calculate the taxable amount.

The form also includes sections for the taxpayer's personal information, such as their name, social security number, and address. There are also sections for the taxpayer's signature and the preparer's information if applicable.

Form 8606 must be attached to the taxpayer's Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR when filing their tax return.
