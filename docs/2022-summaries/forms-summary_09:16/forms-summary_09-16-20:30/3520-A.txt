Form 3520-A is an annual information return that must be filed by foreign trusts with a U.S. owner. The form is used to report general information about the foreign trust, such as its name, address, and creation date. It also includes sections to report whether the foreign trust has appointed a U.S. agent, and if not, the trustee must attach relevant trust documents.

The form also includes sections to report the foreign trust's income and expenses, as well as its balance sheet at the beginning and end of the tax year. There are separate sections for the U.S. owner and U.S. beneficiaries of the foreign trust to report their income attributable to the trust.

The form must be signed by the trustees or U.S. owners under penalties of perjury. It is important to note that all information must be in English and all amounts must be reported in U.S. dollars.
