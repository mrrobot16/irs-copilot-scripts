Form 8275-R is a form provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to disclose any items or positions on their tax return that are contrary to Treasury regulations. This form is used specifically for disclosures related to regulations, while Form 8275 is used for other types of disclosures. The form requires the taxpayer to provide general information about the regulation section, item or group of items, a detailed description, form or schedule, and line number for each disclosure. There is also a section for a detailed explanation of each disclosure. If the disclosure is for a pass-through entity, such as a partnership or S corporation, additional information about the entity is required. The form should be attached to the taxpayer's tax return. The form also includes a section for any additional explanations that couldn't fit in Parts I and II. The form includes a notice about the Paperwork Reduction Act.
