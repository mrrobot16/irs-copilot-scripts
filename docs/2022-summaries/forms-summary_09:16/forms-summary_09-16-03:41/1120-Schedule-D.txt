Schedule D (Form 1120) is a document used for reporting capital gains and losses for corporations. It is attached to various tax forms such as Form 1120, 1120-C, 1120-F, and others. The form consists of three parts.

Part I is for reporting short-term capital gains and losses on assets held for one year or less. It provides spaces to enter the proceeds (sales price), cost (or other basis), adjustments to gain or loss from Form 8949, and the resulting gain or loss. There are separate lines for reporting different types of transactions, such as short-term transactions reported on Form 1099-B, transactions reported on Form 8949 with Box A checked, and so on. The section also includes spaces for reporting short-term capital gain from installment sales, like-kind exchanges, and unused capital loss carryover.

Part II is for reporting long-term capital gains and losses on assets held for more than one year. It follows a similar format to Part I, with spaces for entering proceeds, cost, adjustments to gain or loss from Form 8949, and the resulting gain or loss. There are separate lines for different types of transactions, including long-term transactions reported on Form 1099-B, transactions reported on Form 8949 with Box D, E, or F checked, gain from Form 4797, long-term capital gain from installment sales, long-term capital gain or loss from like-kind exchanges, and capital gain distributions.

Part III is a summary of Parts I and II. It includes lines to calculate the excess of net short-term capital gain over net long-term capital loss, net capital gain, and the total capital gain to be entered on the applicable line of Form 1120 or other tax returns.

The form provides instructions and references to additional forms for reporting specific transactions. It also includes a note to consult the instructions for Capital Losses if losses exceed gains.

This summary provides an overview of the document, but it is important to refer to the instructions and consult a tax professional for accurate and complete reporting of capital gains and losses.
