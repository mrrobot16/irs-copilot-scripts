Form 945-A is an annual record of federal tax liability provided by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. It is used by semiweekly schedule depositors or those who have accumulated a tax liability of $100,000 or more in any given month. The form is used to report the tax liability for each month of the calendar year. The total tax liability for the year is calculated by adding up the tax liabilities for each month. This total must match line 3 on Form 945 (or line 19 on Form CT-1 or line 9 on Form 944). The form includes instructions and can be filed along with Form 945, 945-X, CT-1, CT-1 X, 944, or 944-X.
