Schedule F (Form 965) is a document used by domestic corporations to report foreign taxes deemed paid. It is specifically for foreign corporations in which the filer has a section 965(a) inclusion during the 2020 tax year. The form requires the filer to provide information such as the name and identifying number of the person filing the return, the name of the Deferred Foreign Income Corporation (DFIC), and the EIN or reference ID numbers of the foreign corporation and K-1 issuer (if applicable). It also requires the filer to provide details about the U.S. tax year end of the DFIC, the country of incorporation, and the section 965(a) inclusion in both U.S. dollars and functional currency. The form includes columns for post-1986 undistributed earnings, the division of the section 965(a) inclusion by post-1986 undistributed earnings, opening balance in post-1986 foreign income taxes, foreign taxes paid for the indicated tax year, foreign taxes deemed paid for the indicated tax year, post-1986 foreign income taxes, and taxes deemed paid. The form also provides space to add additional schedules if needed.
