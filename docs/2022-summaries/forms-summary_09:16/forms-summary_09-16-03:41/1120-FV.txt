Schedule V (Form 1120-F) is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that must be attached to Form 1120-F. It is used to list vessels or aircraft, operators, and owners for corporations subject to a 4% tax rate under section 887. The document includes lines for providing information such as the name and ID number of the vessel or aircraft, whether it was chartered in or out, the name and identification number of the registered owner and operator, and the U.S. source gross transportation income. The document also includes calculations for determining the total U.S. source gross transportation income and any amount exempt by treaty. The result is then entered on Form 1120-F, Section I, line 9, column (b).
