Form W-9 is a document used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to request taxpayer identification numbers (TIN) from individuals or entities. The form must be completed and provided to the requester, but it is not sent to the IRS. The form requires the individual or entity to provide their name, business name (if applicable), federal tax classification, exemptions (if applicable), address, and TIN. The form also includes a certification section where the individual or entity certifies their TIN, exemption from backup withholding, U.S. citizenship or status, and FATCA reporting exemption code (if applicable). The form provides instructions for completing each section and includes specific instructions for different types of accounts and entities. The form also includes information on backup withholding, FATCA reporting, updating information, penalties for non-compliance, and how to protect tax records from identity theft.
