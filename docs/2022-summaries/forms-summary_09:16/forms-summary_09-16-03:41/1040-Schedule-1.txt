Schedule 1 (Form 1040) is a document that taxpayers must attach to their Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR when filing their taxes. It includes two parts: Additional Income and Adjustments to Income.

Part I, Additional Income, lists various types of income that may need to be reported on the tax return. This includes taxable refunds, alimony received, business income or loss, other gains or losses, rental real estate income, farm income or loss, unemployment compensation, and other types of income such as net operating loss, gambling winnings, cancellation of debt, foreign earned income exclusion, and more. Taxpayers must provide the necessary details for each type of income.

Part II, Adjustments to Income, lists various deductions and adjustments that can be made to reduce taxable income. This includes educator expenses, certain business expenses for reservists, performing artists, and fee-basis government officials, health savings account deduction, moving expenses for members of the Armed Forces, self-employment tax deduction, self-employed retirement plans, self-employed health insurance deduction, penalty on early withdrawal of savings, alimony paid, IRA deduction, student loan interest deduction, and other adjustments such as jury duty pay, deductible expenses related to rental income, contributions to pension plans, attorney fees, and more. Taxpayers must provide the necessary details for each adjustment.

The totals from Part I and Part II are then entered on the appropriate lines of Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. The document also includes instructions and a space for taxpayers to list any other income or adjustments that are not already included on the form.

It's important for taxpayers to consult the official instructions and the latest information provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) when completing Schedule 1.
