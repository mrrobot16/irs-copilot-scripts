Form 8957 is a document used for the registration of financial institutions under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). The form requires applicants to provide information about their financial institution, including its type, legal name, country/jurisdiction of residence for tax purposes, and tax ID. Applicants must also select the FATCA classification of their institution and provide its mailing address.

The form includes questions about whether the financial institution has a withholding agreement with the IRS as a Qualified Intermediary (QI), Withholding Foreign Partnership (WP), or Withholding Foreign Trust (WT). If applicable, the institution must provide the corresponding EIN and indicate whether it intends to maintain its status as a QI, WP, or WT.

The form also asks whether the financial institution maintains a branch outside of its country/jurisdiction of tax residence and, if so, whether it is a tax resident of the United States or has a branch in the United States. The institution must provide the necessary details in these cases.

The form requires the designation of a FATCA Responsible Officer (RO) for the financial institution, including their business title, legal name, address, telephone number, fax number, and email address.

There is an option to designate additional points of contact (POCs) for the financial institution, and the RO or an Authorizing Individual must provide the necessary information for each designated POC.

If the financial institution is a lead of an Expanded Affiliated Group, additional information about each member financial institution in the group must be provided, including their legal name, country/jurisdiction of residence for tax purposes, and FATCA classification type.

The form concludes with a certification section where the person completing the form certifies the accuracy and completeness of the information provided and agrees to comply with FATCA obligations.

It is recommended to complete the form online at the IRS website for faster processing, although a paper form can be mailed to the designated address in Austin, Texas.
