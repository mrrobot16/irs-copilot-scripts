Form 1042-S is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for reporting foreign persons' U.S. source income subject to withholding. It contains various boxes for reporting income, exemptions, tax rates, withholding allowances, and other relevant information. The form is used by withholding agents to report income and withholding tax information to both the IRS and the recipients of the income. Recipients may need to attach copies of Form 1042-S to their federal and state tax returns. The form includes codes for different types of income, exemption categories, and status codes for withholding agents, recipients, intermediaries, and payers. It is important for foreign persons to understand the requirements for filing U.S. income tax returns and the specific codes and instructions provided on Form 1042-S.
