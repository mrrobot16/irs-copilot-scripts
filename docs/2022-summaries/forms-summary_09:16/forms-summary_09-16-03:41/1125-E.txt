Form 1125-E is a document that is attached to Form 1120, 1120-C, 1120-F, 1120-REIT, 1120-RIC, or 1120S for reporting the compensation of officers. The form requires the name of the officer, their social security number, the percent of time devoted to the business, the percent of stock owned, and the amount of compensation. The form is only required if the total receipts are $500,000 or more. The total compensation of officers is calculated by subtracting the compensation claimed on Form 1125-A or elsewhere on the tax return from the total compensation reported on the form. The result is then entered on the appropriate line of the tax return.
