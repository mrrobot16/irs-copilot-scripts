Schedule B (Form 1040) is a document provided by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service for reporting interest and ordinary dividends on your tax return. It is to be attached to Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

The form consists of three parts:

Part I: Interest
- This section is for reporting interest income.
- If you received a Form 1099-INT, Form 1099-OID, or substitute statement from a brokerage firm, you should list the payer's name and enter the total interest shown on that form.
- There is an option to exclude interest on series EE and I U.S. savings bonds issued after 1989 by attaching Form 8815.
- The result of subtracting line 3 from line 2 should be entered on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 2b.
- If line 4 is over $1,500, you must complete Part III.

Part II: Ordinary Dividends
- This section is for reporting ordinary dividends.
- If you received a Form 1099-DIV or substitute statement from a brokerage firm, you should list the payer's name and enter the ordinary dividends shown on that form.
- The total amount of ordinary dividends should be entered on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 3b.
- If line 6 is over $1,500, you must complete Part III.

Part III: Foreign Accounts and Trusts
- This part is required if you had over $1,500 of taxable interest or ordinary dividends, had a foreign account, or received a distribution from, or were a grantor of, or a transferor to, a foreign trust.
- It includes questions about financial interest in or signature authority over a foreign financial account and the requirement to file FinCEN Form 114 (FBAR).
- There is also a question about receiving a distribution from, or being the grantor of, or transferor to, a foreign trust, which may require filing Form 3520.

The form provides cautionary information about the penalties for not filing FinCEN Form 114 and the possible requirement to file Form 8938 for specified foreign financial assets.

Overall, Schedule B (Form 1040) is used to report interest and ordinary dividends, with additional sections for foreign accounts and trusts if applicable.
