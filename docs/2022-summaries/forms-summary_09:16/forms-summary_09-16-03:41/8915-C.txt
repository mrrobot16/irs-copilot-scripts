Form 8915-C is a document provided by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for individuals to report qualified 2018 disaster retirement plan distributions and repayments on their tax returns. The form is to be attached to the individual's 2022 Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form consists of two parts: Part I for reporting qualified 2018 disaster distributions from retirement plans other than IRAs, and Part II for reporting qualified 2018 disaster distributions from Traditional, SEP, SIMPLE, and Roth IRAs.

In each part, the form includes various lines for entering specific amounts from previous years' forms, such as 2020 Form 8915-C and 2021 Form 8915-C. These amounts are used to calculate excess repayments and the total amount subject to tax in 2022.

The form also includes sections for the individual's personal information, such as name, social security number, and address. There is a signature section for the individual to declare the accuracy of the form.

It is important to note that this form is specifically for reporting qualified 2018 disaster distributions and repayments and should not be used for other types of disaster distributions. The latest instructions and information can be found on the IRS website.
