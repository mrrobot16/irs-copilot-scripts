The form is to be attached to the taxpayer's tax return. The form includes various sections and instructions for completing them. It asks for information such as whether the taxpayer paid premiums for employee health insurance coverage through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace, the number of employees and full-time equivalent employees (FTEs), average annual wages, premiums paid for health insurance coverage, and calculations for determining the applicable credit percentage. The form also includes sections for partnerships, S corporations, cooperatives, estates, and trusts to report their specific information. The final lines of the form provide instructions for reporting the calculated credit amount on the appropriate tax forms, such as Schedule K or Form 3800.
