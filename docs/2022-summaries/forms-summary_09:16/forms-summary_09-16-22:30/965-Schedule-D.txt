Schedule D (Form 965) is a document that is used by U.S. shareholders of specified foreign corporations to report their aggregate foreign cash position. The form is attached to Form 965 and is filed with the Department of the Treasury's Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 

The form requires the taxpayer to provide their name, identifying number, and the name and EIN or reference ID number of the specified foreign corporation. The form also requires the taxpayer to report the cash position at the close of the last taxable year prior to the year referenced in column (d), as well as the pro rata share of that cash position. 

The form also requires the taxpayer to report the cash position at the close of the last taxable year that ends before November 2, 2017, and the pro rata share of that cash position. Additionally, the taxpayer must report the cash position at the close of the last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, and the pro rata share of that cash position. 

The form provides space for the taxpayer to enter these amounts in U.S. Dollars, and additional schedules can be added if necessary. The form also includes calculations to determine the total of column (g), the combined totals of columns (c) and (e) divided by two, and the aggregate foreign cash position, which is the larger of the amount on line 17 or the amount on line 18. 

Finally, the form requires the taxpayer to report the aggregate foreign cash position taken into account on the 2017 and 2018 tax returns. The form also includes a second page with additional instructions and information.
