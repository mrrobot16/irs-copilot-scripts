Form 965-D is a document used by taxpayers to report the transfer of a tax liability under Section 965(i)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. The form is divided into several parts, including sections for transferor information, transferee information, identifying information of the S Corporation, the triggering event leading to the transfer agreement, reporting of unpaid section 965(i) net tax liability, transferee's ability to pay the remaining liability, and the terms of the agreement.

The form requires the transferor to provide their information, including their name, taxpayer identification number, and address. The transferee is also required to provide their information, including their name, taxpayer identification number, and address. The form also asks for the identifying information of the S Corporation with respect to which the section 965(i) election was effective.

The form then asks for details about the triggering event that led to the transfer agreement, including the date of the event and whether the transfer was due to the death of the transferor. The form also requires the transferor to provide the percentage of their deferred net tax liability that is properly allocable to the portion of stock being transferred to the transferee.

Next, the form asks the transferor to report the amount of their unpaid section 965(i) net tax liability being assumed by the transferee. The form also asks whether the transferee is able to pay the net tax liability being assumed and whether their leverage ratio exceeded 3:1 immediately after the triggering event. The form provides space for any additional information pertaining to the transferee's ability to pay.

Finally, the form includes a section where both the transferor and transferee must sign, agreeing to the terms of the transfer agreement. The agreement states that the transferee assumes the liability of the transferor for the unpaid portion of the section 965(i) net tax liability and agrees to comply with all applicable requirements. The transferor and any successor to the transferor remain jointly and severally liable for the liability being assumed. The agreement also allows the Commissioner to request additional information and provides consequences for material misrepresentation or omission.

Overall, Form 965-D is used to document the transfer of a tax liability under Section 965(i)(2) and ensure compliance with the applicable regulations.
