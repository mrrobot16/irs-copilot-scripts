It is attached to Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, Form 1040-NR, Form 1041, or Form 1065. The form contains several parts and requires the taxpayer to provide information such as their principal crop or activity, accounting method (cash or accrual), employer ID number (EIN), and whether they materially participated in the operation of the business.

Part I of the form is for reporting farm income using the cash method. It includes sections for reporting sales of purchased livestock and other resale items, sales of livestock and other products raised, cooperative distributions, agricultural program payments, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loans, crop insurance proceeds, custom hire income, and other income.

It includes sections for reporting expenses such as car and truck expenses, chemicals, conservation expenses, custom hire expenses, depreciation and section 179 expense, employee benefit programs, feed, fertilizers and lime, freight and trucking, gasoline, fuel, and oil, insurance, interest, labor hired, pension and profit-sharing plans, rent or lease, repairs and maintenance, seeds and plants, storage and warehousing, supplies, taxes, utilities, veterinary, breeding, and medicine, and other expenses.

Part III of the form is for reporting farm income using the accrual method. It includes sections for reporting sales of livestock, produce, grains, and other products, cooperative distributions, agricultural program payments, CCC loans, crop insurance proceeds, custom hire income, and other income. It also requires the taxpayer to report the inventory of livestock, produce, grains, and other products at the beginning and end of the year, as well as the cost of livestock, produce, grains, and other products purchased and sold during the year.
