Form 8978 is a tax form used by partners to report additional taxes, penalties, and interest for a specific tax year. The form is divided into three parts.

Part I requires the partner to compute the additional reporting year tax. This includes providing the tax year ended dates and calculating the total income and deductions per the original return or as previously adjusted. Adjustments to income and deductions are also taken into account. The corrected taxable income is then determined by subtracting the corrected deductions from the corrected income. The form also requires the calculation of income tax and alternative minimum tax on the corrected taxable income. The total corrected income tax is obtained by adding the income tax and alternative minimum tax. Additionally, adjustments to credits are accounted for, and the corrected credits are calculated. The total corrected income tax liability is determined by subtracting the corrected credits from the total corrected income tax. The increase or decrease to tax is calculated by subtracting the total income tax shown on the original return or as previously adjusted from the total corrected income tax liability. This increase or decrease to tax is then entered on the appropriate line of the tax return.

Part II of the form deals with penalties. The partner is required to report any penalties incurred and calculate the total penalties by adding up the penalties for each column (a) through (d).

Part III addresses interest. The partner is required to report the amount of interest incurred and calculate the total interest by adding up the interest for each column (a) through (d).

The form includes instructions for completing each section and directs users to the IRS website for the latest information and instructions.
