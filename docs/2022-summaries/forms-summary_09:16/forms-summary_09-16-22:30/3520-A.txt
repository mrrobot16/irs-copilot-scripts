There is a section for providing information about the U.S. agent and the trustee of the foreign trust. The form also includes sections for reporting the foreign trust's income statement and balance sheet.

In addition, the form includes separate sections for U.S. owners and U.S. beneficiaries of the foreign trust to report their respective income attributable to the trust and any distributions received.
