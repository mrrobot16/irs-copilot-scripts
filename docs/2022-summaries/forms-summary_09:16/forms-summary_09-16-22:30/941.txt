Form 941 is the Employers Quarterly Federal Tax Return used by employers in the United States to report wages, tips, and other compensation paid to employees, as well as the corresponding taxes withheld. The form is divided into several parts.

Part 1 of the form requires employers to answer questions related to the number of employees who received wages, tips, or other compensation during the quarter, as well as the total wages and federal income tax withheld.

Part 1 also includes columns for reporting taxable social security wages, qualified sick leave wages, qualified family leave wages, taxable social security tips, taxable Medicare wages and tips, and taxable wages and tips subject to Additional Medicare Tax withholding. The form provides instructions on how to calculate these amounts.

Part 1 also includes a section for reporting the Section 3121(q) Notice and Demand tax due on unreported tips.

Part 1 concludes with adjustments for fractions of cents, sick pay, tips, and group-term life insurance, and calculates the total taxes after adjustments.

Part 2 of the form is used to report the deposit schedule and tax liability for the quarter. Employers must indicate whether they are a monthly schedule depositor or a semiweekly schedule depositor and provide the tax liability for each month or attach Schedule B (Form 941) for semiweekly schedule depositors.

Part 3 of the form is used to provide additional information about the business, such as whether the business has closed or stopped paying wages, and if the business is a seasonal employer.

Part 4 of the form asks if a third-party designee is authorized to speak with the IRS on behalf of the employer.

Part 5 of the form is where the employer must sign the form, declaring that the information provided is true, correct, and complete.

The form also includes a separate payment voucher, Form 941-V, which employers can use to make a payment with Form 941. The voucher includes instructions for completing and submitting the payment.

The form includes a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, which explains the purpose of collecting the information and the confidentiality of tax returns.

The form concludes with information about the estimated average time to complete and file Form 941, as well as instructions on where to send the form.
