Schedule 3 (Form 1040) is a document that taxpayers in the United States use to report additional credits and payments on their federal income tax return. It is attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

Part I of Schedule 3 is used to report nonrefundable credits. It includes various credits such as the foreign tax credit, child and dependent care expenses credit, education credits, retirement savings contributions credit, residential energy credits, and other nonrefundable credits.

Part II of Schedule 3 is used to report other payments and refundable credits. It includes the net premium tax credit, amount paid with a request for an extension to file, excess social security and tier 1 RRTA tax withheld, credit for federal tax on fuels, and other payments or refundable credits.

Taxpayers are required to fill out the appropriate sections of Schedule 3 and then add up the amounts from each part. The totals are then entered on the respective lines of Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.
