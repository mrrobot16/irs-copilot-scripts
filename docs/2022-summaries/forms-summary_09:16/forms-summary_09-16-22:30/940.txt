Form 940 is the Employers Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return for the year 2022. It is used by employers to report their FUTA tax liability and make payments. The form is divided into several parts.

Part 1 asks for general information about the employer, including their name, address, and employer identification number (EIN). It also includes checkboxes for different types of returns, such as amended returns or returns for businesses that have closed or stopped paying wages.

Part 2 is used to determine the FUTA tax before adjustments. It includes lines for the total payments to all employees, payments exempt from FUTA tax, and payments made to each employee in excess of $7,000. These amounts are used to calculate the total taxable FUTA wages and the FUTA tax before adjustments.

Part 3 is used to determine adjustments to the FUTA tax. It includes lines for taxable FUTA wages that were excluded from state unemployment tax, late payments of state unemployment tax, and credit reduction. These adjustments are added to the FUTA tax before adjustments to calculate the total FUTA tax after adjustments.

Part 4 is used to determine the final FUTA tax liability and any balance due or overpayment. It includes lines for the total FUTA tax after adjustments, FUTA tax deposited for the year, and any balance due or overpayment. If the balance due is more than $500, the employer must deposit the tax. If the balance due is $500 or less, it can be paid with the return.

Part 5 is used to report the FUTA tax liability by quarter if the total FUTA tax after adjustments is more than $500. If not, the employer can skip this part.

Part 6 asks if the employer wants to designate a third-party designee to discuss the return with the IRS.

Part 7 is where the employer must sign the form under penalties of perjury, declaring that the return is true, correct, and complete.

The document also includes instructions for completing Form 940, as well as a separate payment voucher (Form 940-V) for making payments with the form. The instructions provide specific guidance for each box on the form and explain the requirements for making payments and deposits.

The document concludes with a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, which explains the purpose of the form and the confidentiality of the information provided. It also includes estimated average times for completing and filing the form and provides information on where to send comments or suggestions for improving the form.
