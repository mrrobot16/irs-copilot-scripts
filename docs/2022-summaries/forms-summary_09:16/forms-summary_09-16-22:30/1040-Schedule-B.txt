Schedule B (Form 1040) is a document provided by the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for reporting interest and ordinary dividends on a taxpayer's tax return. It is to be attached to Form 1040 or 1040-SR. The form consists of three parts.

Part I is for reporting interest income. Taxpayers are instructed to list the name of the payer and the amount of interest received. If the interest is from a seller-financed mortgage used for personal residence, additional information is required. Excludable interest on series EE and I U.S. savings bonds issued after 1989 should be reported separately by attaching Form 8815. The total interest income is calculated by adding the amounts reported.

Part II is for reporting ordinary dividends. Taxpayers are instructed to list the name of the payer and the amount of ordinary dividends received. The total amount of ordinary dividends is calculated by adding the amounts reported.

Part III is for reporting foreign accounts and trusts. Taxpayers are required to complete this part if they had over $1,500 of taxable interest or ordinary dividends, had a foreign account, or received a distribution from, or were a grantor of, or a transferor to, a foreign trust. The part includes questions about financial interest in foreign accounts and the requirement to file FinCEN Form 114 (FBAR) or Form 3520 for foreign trusts.

The form includes references to instructions and other forms for further guidance and filing requirements. Failure to file required forms may result in penalties.
