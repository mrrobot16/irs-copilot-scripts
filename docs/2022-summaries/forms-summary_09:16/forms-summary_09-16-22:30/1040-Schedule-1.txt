Schedule 1 (Form 1040) is a document that taxpayers in the United States use to report additional income and adjustments to income. It is attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. The form is divided into two parts.

Part I, "Additional Income," includes various types of additional income that taxpayers may need to report, such as taxable refunds, alimony received, business income or loss, other gains or losses, rental real estate income, farm income or loss, unemployment compensation, and other types of income.

Part II, "Adjustments to Income," includes deductions and adjustments that taxpayers can claim to reduce their taxable income. These include educator expenses, certain business expenses for reservists, performing artists, and fee-basis government officials, health savings account deductions, moving expenses for members of the Armed Forces, self-employment tax deductions, self-employed retirement plan deductions, self-employed health insurance deductions, penalties on early withdrawal of savings, alimony paid, IRA deductions, student loan interest deductions, and other adjustments.

Taxpayers are instructed to add up the amounts reported in both parts and enter the total on the corresponding line of their Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form also includes spaces for taxpayers to provide additional information about specific types of income or adjustments, as well as a section for other adjustments not listed on the form.

Taxpayers should refer to the instructions provided on the IRS website for more information and guidance on completing Schedule 1.
