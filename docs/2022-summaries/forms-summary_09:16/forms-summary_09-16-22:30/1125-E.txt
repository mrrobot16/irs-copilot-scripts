Form 1125-E is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that should be attached to Form 1120, 1120-C, 1120-F, 1120-REIT, 1120-RIC, or 1120S. This form is used to report the compensation of officers for a business. It is only required to be completed if the total receipts of the business are $500,000 or more.

The form requires the name and employer identification number of the business. It then asks for information about each officer, including their name, social security number, percent of time devoted to the business, percent of stock owned, and the amount of compensation they received.

The form also includes a section to report any compensation of officers that has already been claimed on Form 1125-A or elsewhere on the tax return.

Finally, the form calculates the total compensation of officers by subtracting the compensation claimed on Form 1125-A or elsewhere from the total compensation reported.

The form includes a reference to the Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, which provides information about the collection of information and its estimated burden.
