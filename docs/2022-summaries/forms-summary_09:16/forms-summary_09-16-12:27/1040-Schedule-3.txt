Schedule 3 (Form 1040) is a document that taxpayers in the United States can use to report additional credits and payments on their federal income tax return. It is attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form is divided into two parts: Part I for nonrefundable credits and Part II for other payments and refundable credits.

In Part I, taxpayers can report various nonrefundable credits, such as the foreign tax credit, child and dependent care expenses credit, education credits, retirement savings contributions credit, residential energy credits, and other nonrefundable credits.

In Part II, taxpayers can report other payments and refundable credits, including the net premium tax credit, amount paid with a request for an extension to file, excess social security and tier 1 RRTA tax withheld, credit for federal tax on fuels, and other payments or refundable credits.

The form provides spaces to attach the necessary forms and schedules for each credit or payment being reported.

Once all the credits and payments have been reported, taxpayers are instructed to add up the amounts on each line and enter the total on the appropriate line of their Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form also includes spaces for taxpayers to list any other nonrefundable credits or other payments or refundable credits that are not specifically mentioned on the form.

Taxpayers should refer to the instructions provided on the IRS website for more information and guidance on completing Schedule 3.
