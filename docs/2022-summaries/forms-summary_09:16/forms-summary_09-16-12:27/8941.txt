If the answer is yes, the taxpayer must enter the Marketplace Identifier. If the answer is no, the taxpayer may be eligible for an exception.

Section B asks for the employer identification number (EIN) used to report employment taxes if it is different from the identifying number listed above.

Section C asks whether the taxpayer or any predecessor filed a Form 8941 for a tax year between 2013 and 2021 with line A checked yes and line 12 showing a positive amount.
