Schedule G-1 is a form that is attached to Form 5471 for reporting information about a Cost Sharing Arrangement (CSA) in which a foreign corporation is a participant. The form requires the filer to provide a brief description of the CSA and indicate whether the foreign corporation became a participant during the tax year. It also asks if the CSA was in effect before January 5, 2009.

The form asks for the foreign corporation's share of reasonably anticipated benefits for the CSA during the tax year, expressed as a percentage. It also asks if a U.S. taxpayer made any platform contributions to the CSA during the tax year and if so, the present value of those contributions in U.S. dollars. The filer must also indicate the method used to determine the price of the platform contribution transaction(s).

The form asks for information about stock-based compensation deductions claimed by the filer for the tax year, as well as deductions for stock-based compensation granted during the term of the CSA that is directly identified with or reasonably allocable to the intangible development activity under the CSA. It also asks if there was any stock-based compensation granted during the term of the CSA that was not treated as directly identified with or reasonably allocable to the intangible development activity.

Finally, the form asks for the total amount of intangible development costs for the CSA during the tax year, as well as the amount of those costs allocable to the foreign corporation based on its share of reasonably anticipated benefits.

The form provides space for the name of the person filing Form 5471, their identifying number, the name of the foreign corporation, its EIN (if any), and a reference ID number. It is important to complete a separate Schedule G-1 for each CSA in which the foreign corporation was a participant during the tax year, and all amounts should be reported in U.S. dollars.
