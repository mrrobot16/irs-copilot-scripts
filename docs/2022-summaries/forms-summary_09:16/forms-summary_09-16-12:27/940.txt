Form 940 is the Employers Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return for the year 2022. It is used by employers in the United States to report their FUTA tax liability and make payments to the IRS. The form requires the employer to provide their employer identification number (EIN), name, trade name (if any), address, and other relevant information.

The form is divided into several parts. Part 1 asks for general information about the return, including whether it is an amended return, if the employer is a successor employer, if there were no payments to employees in 2022, or if the business has closed or stopped paying wages. Part 2 calculates the FUTA tax before adjustments, including total payments to employees, payments exempt from FUTA tax, and total taxable FUTA wages. Part 3 determines adjustments to the FUTA tax, such as exclusions from state unemployment tax and credit reduction. Part 4 calculates the final FUTA tax liability and any balance due or overpayment. Part 5 reports the FUTA tax liability by quarter if it exceeds $500. Part 6 allows the employer to designate a third-party designee to discuss the return with the IRS. Part 7 requires the employer to sign the form under penalties of perjury.

The document also includes instructions for completing Form 940-V, the Payment Voucher, which is used when making a payment with Form 940. The voucher is detached and sent with the payment and Form 940 to the IRS.

The document concludes with a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, which explains the purpose of the form and the confidentiality of tax information. It also provides estimated average times for completing and filing the form and includes information on where to send comments or suggestions regarding the form.
