Schedule F (Form 1040) is a tax form used by farmers in the United States to report their profit or loss from farming activities. It is attached to Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, Form 1040-NR, Form 1041, or Form 1065. The form includes various sections to report farm income, expenses, and inventory.

The form begins with basic information such as the name of the proprietor and their social security number. It then asks for the principal crop or activity of the farm and requires the entry of a code from Part IV that best identifies the primary farming activity.

Farmers are asked to indicate their accounting method (cash or accrual) and provide their Employer ID number (EIN) if applicable. They are also asked if they materially participated in the operation of the business during the tax year and if they made any payments that would require filing Form(s) 1099.

Part I of the form is for reporting farm income using the cash method. It includes sections to report sales of purchased livestock and other resale items, sales of livestock, produce, grains, and other products raised, cooperative distributions, agricultural program payments, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loans, crop insurance proceeds, federal crop disaster payments, custom hire (machine work) income, and other income.

Part II is for reporting farm expenses using both the cash and accrual methods. It includes sections for various expenses such as car and truck expenses, chemicals, conservation expenses, custom hire (machine work), depreciation and section 179 expense, employee benefit programs, feed, fertilizers and lime, freight and trucking, gasoline, fuel, and oil, insurance, interest, labor hired, pension and profit-sharing plans, rent or lease, repairs and maintenance, seeds and plants, storage and warehousing, supplies, taxes, utilities, and veterinary, breeding, and medicine expenses. There is also a section for reporting other expenses.

The total expenses are calculated by adding up the amounts from lines 10 through 32f. The net farm profit or loss is then determined by subtracting the total expenses from the gross income reported on line 9.

If there is a profit, the farmer can stop at this point and follow the instructions for where to report the profit. If there is a loss, the farmer must complete line 36 and check the box that describes their investment in the farming activity.

Part III of the form is for farmers who use the accrual method to report their farm income. It includes sections for reporting sales of livestock, produce, grains, and other products, cooperative distributions, agricultural program payments, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loans, crop insurance proceeds, and other income. There are also sections for reporting the inventory of livestock, produce, grains, and other products at the beginning and end of the year, as well as the cost of livestock, produce, grains, and other products purchased and sold during the year.

Part IV provides a list of Principal Agricultural Activity Codes that classify farms based on their primary activity. Farmers are instructed to select the code that best identifies their primary farming activity and enter the six-digit number on line B.

Overall, Schedule F (Form 1040) is a detailed tax form that helps farmers report their farming income, expenses, and inventory accurately to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
