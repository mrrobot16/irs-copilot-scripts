Form W-9 is a document issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used to request taxpayer identification numbers (TINs) and certifications from individuals and entities. The form is not sent to the IRS but is given to the requester. The form requires the taxpayer to provide their name, business name (if applicable), federal tax classification, exemptions (if any), address, and TIN. The TIN can be a social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), or employer identification number (EIN). The taxpayer must also certify certain statements under penalties of perjury. The form provides instructions and guidance on how to complete it accurately. Failure to provide a correct TIN or false information may result in penalties. The form is used for various purposes, including reporting income, dividends, and interest, as well as for FATCA reporting.
