Form 1099-Q is a tax form used to report payments from qualified education programs under sections 529 and 530 of the Internal Revenue Code. The form is divided into three copies: Copy A is filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Copy B is furnished to the recipient, and Copy C is kept by the payer/trustee.

The form includes sections for the payer/trustee's name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN), as well as the recipient's TIN, name, address, and account number. It also includes the following boxes to report information about the distribution:

- Box 1: Gross distribution, including in-kind distributions, from a qualified tuition program (QTP) or a Coverdell education savings account (CESA).

- Box 4: Indicates if there was a trustee-to-trustee transfer.
- Box 5: Indicates if the distribution is from a QTP (private or state) or a CESA.

The form provides instructions for recipients on how to determine the taxability of the distribution and references publications and forms for more information. It also includes instructions for payers/trustees on how to complete the form and where to find additional resources for assistance.

The form warns recipients that failure to report taxable income may result in penalties or sanctions imposed by the IRS. It also mentions that the payer/trustee may only show the last four digits of the recipient's TIN on the form, but the complete TIN has been reported to the IRS.

The form includes information about distribution codes that may be reported by the payer/trustee to identify the type of distribution received. It also provides information about future developments related to Form 1099-Q.

Overall, Form 1099-Q is used to report payments from qualified education programs and provides important tax information for both the IRS and the recipients.
