Form 982 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that taxpayers must attach to their income tax return. The purpose of this form is to report the reduction of tax attributes due to the discharge of indebtedness and to make a section 1082 basis adjustment.

The form begins with Part I, which requires the taxpayer to provide general information and check the applicable box(es) to indicate the reason for the exclusion of the discharged indebtedness. The options include discharge of indebtedness in a title 11 case, discharge of indebtedness to the extent insolvent, discharge of qualified farm indebtedness, discharge of qualified real property business indebtedness, and discharge of qualified principal residence indebtedness.

In Part II, the taxpayer must enter the amount of discharged indebtedness excluded from gross income and provide a description of any transactions resulting in the reduction in basis under section 1017. This section also includes options for applying the exclusion to reduce the basis of depreciable real property, reduce net operating losses, reduce general business credit carryovers, reduce minimum tax credit, reduce net capital losses, and reduce the basis of nondepreciable and depreciable property.

Part III is only applicable to corporations and requires the consent of the corporation to adjust the basis of its property under section 1082(a)(2). The corporation must provide information about the excluded amount, the tax year, and the state of incorporation.

Taxpayers should refer to the instructions provided on the IRS website for detailed guidance on completing Form 982.
