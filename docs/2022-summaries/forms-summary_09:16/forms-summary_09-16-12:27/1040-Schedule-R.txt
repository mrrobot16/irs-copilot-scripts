Schedule R (Form 1040) is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim the Credit for the Elderly or the Disabled. The credit can be taken if the taxpayer is either 65 years or older by the end of the tax year or under 65 and retired on permanent and total disability with taxable disability income. However, there are other tests that need to be met as well.

The form has three parts. In Part I, the taxpayer needs to check the appropriate box for their filing status and age. There are different boxes for single, head of household, qualifying surviving spouse, married filing jointly, and married filing separately. Depending on the box checked, the taxpayer may need to complete Part II and Part III.

Part II is a statement of permanent and total disability and needs to be completed if the taxpayer checked specific boxes in Part I. If the taxpayer has a physician's statement for their disability filed in 1983 or earlier, or for tax years after 1983 with the physician's signature, and they were unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity in 2022 due to their disability, they can check a box and are not required to get another statement for 2022. Otherwise, they need to have their physician complete the statement provided in the instructions.

Part III is where the taxpayer calculates their credit. Depending on the box checked in Part I, they enter a specific amount on line 10. If they checked certain other boxes, they may need to complete line 11 by adding taxable disability income or spouse's taxable disability income. The taxpayer then enters the smaller of line 10 or line 11 on line 12. They also need to enter any pensions, annuities, or disability income received in 2022 that is nontaxable on lines 13a, 13b, and 13c. The amount from Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11 is entered on line 14. The taxpayer then subtracts line 15 from line 14 and enters the result on line 16. One-half of line 16 is entered on line 17. The taxpayer adds lines 13c and 17 on line 18. If the result on line 18 is zero or less, they cannot take the credit. Otherwise, they multiply line 19 by 15% and enter the result on line 20. The taxpayer enters the tax liability limit from the Credit Limit Worksheet in the instructions on line 21. Finally, they enter the smaller of line 20 or line 21 on line 22, which is also entered on Schedule 3 (Form 1040), line 6d.

The form includes additional instructions and information on where to find the latest information and instructions on the IRS website.
