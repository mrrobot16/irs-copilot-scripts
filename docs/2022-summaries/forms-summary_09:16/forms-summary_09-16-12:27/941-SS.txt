Form 941-SS is the Employers Quarterly Federal Tax Return for American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is used by employers in these territories to report wages, tips, and other compensation paid to employees and calculate the social security and Medicare taxes owed. 

The form is divided into several parts. Part 1 asks for information about the number of employees and the wages and tips paid to them during the quarter. Part 2 is for reporting adjustments and credits. Part 3 asks for information about the business, such as whether it has closed or if it is a seasonal employer. Part 4 asks if the taxpayer wants to designate a third-party to discuss the return with the IRS. Part 5 is where the taxpayer must sign the form.

The form also includes a payment voucher, Form 941-V(SS), which is used to make a payment with Form 941-SS. It provides instructions on how to complete the voucher and where to send it with the payment.

The form includes a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, which explains the purpose of the form and the legal requirements for providing the requested information. It also provides an estimate of the time it takes to complete and file the form and gives information on where to send comments or suggestions for improving the form.
