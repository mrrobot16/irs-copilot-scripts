Form W-8IMY is a certificate used by foreign intermediaries, foreign flow-through entities, or certain U.S. branches to certify their status for tax withholding and reporting purposes in the United States. This form is not to be sent to the IRS but rather provided to the withholding agent or payer. The form provides various checkboxes for the entity to indicate its specific status and includes sections for identification of the entity, certifications for qualified intermediaries, nonqualified intermediaries, territory financial institutions, U.S. branches, withholding foreign partnerships, withholding foreign trusts, nonwithholding foreign partnerships, nonwithholding foreign simple trusts, nonwithholding foreign grantor trusts, and more. The form also includes certifications for chapter 4 status (FATCA status) and requires the signature of an authorized official.
