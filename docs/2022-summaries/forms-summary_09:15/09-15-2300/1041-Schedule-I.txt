Schedule I (Form 1041) is a document used by estates and trusts to calculate their share of alternative minimum taxable income and determine if they are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The form consists of three parts.

Part I requires the estate or trust to report various adjustments to their total income or loss, including interest, taxes, refunds of taxes, depletion, net operating loss deduction, interest from specified private activity bonds, qualified small business stock, exercise of incentive stock options, other estates and trusts income, disposition of property, depreciation on assets, passive activities, loss limitations, circulation costs, long-term contracts, mining costs, research and experimental costs, income from certain installment sales, and intangible drilling costs preference. These adjustments are used to calculate the adjusted alternative minimum taxable income.

Part II focuses on the income distribution deduction on a minimum tax basis. It involves calculating the adjusted alternative minimum taxable income, adjusted tax-exempt interest, total net gain from Schedule D, capital gains for charitable purposes, capital gains paid or set aside for charitable purposes, capital gains computed on a minimum tax basis, capital losses computed on a minimum tax basis, and distributable net alternative minimum taxable income. These calculations are used to determine the income distribution deduction on a minimum tax basis.

Part III calculates the alternative minimum tax by considering the exemption amount, phase-out of the exemption amount, tentative minimum tax, and the tax from Form 1041, Schedule G. The result is the alternative minimum tax that needs to be reported on Form 1041, Schedule G.

Part IV provides a computation using maximum capital gains rates. It involves determining the maximum amount subject to the 0% rate, the maximum amount subject to rates below 20%, and calculating the tax based on these amounts.

The form also includes instructions and references to other schedules and worksheets that may be necessary for completing the calculations.

Overall, Schedule I (Form 1041) helps estates and trusts determine their alternative minimum taxable income and calculate the corresponding alternative minimum tax.
