Form 1097-BTC is a document used by issuers of certain tax credit bonds or their agents to report the amount of tax credit allowed for each month of the calendar year. Recipients of Form 1097-BTC who are further distributing the credit must also report this information to the IRS on a separate form. The form includes information such as the issuer's name, address, and taxpayer identification number, as well as the recipient's name and address. It also includes boxes to report the total credit amount for each month of the year and any additional comments. The form includes instructions for both recipients and payers on how to complete and furnish the form, as well as information on tax credit limitations and future developments related to the form.
