Form 8858 is an information return that U.S. persons must file with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to report their ownership or interest in foreign disregarded entities (FDEs) and foreign branches (FBs). The form requires the filer to provide various information, including the name and address of the FDE or FB, its identifying number, country of organization, and principal business activity. The form also asks for details about the filer's tax year, the tax owner of the FDE or FB (if different from the filer), the direct owner of the FDE or FB (if different from the tax owner), and an organizational chart showing the ownership chain.

The form includes several schedules for reporting income, balance sheet information, and other details. For example, Schedule C is used to report the income statement of the FDE or FB, including gross receipts, cost of goods sold, and net income. Schedule G asks for additional information, such as whether the FDE or FB owned an interest in a trust, had certain transactions with related parties, or paid foreign taxes that may affect the U.S. tax liability.

Schedule H is used to report the current earnings and profits or taxable income of the FDE or FB, while Schedule I is used to report any transferred loss amounts from an FB to a foreign corporation. Schedule J is used to report foreign income taxes paid or accrued, including separate categories for foreign branch income taxes, passive income taxes, and general income taxes.

Overall, Form 8858 is a comprehensive information return that helps the IRS gather information about U.S. persons' ownership or interest in foreign disregarded entities and foreign branches for tax purposes.
