Form 1125-E is a document that is used to report the compensation of officers for tax purposes. It is attached to Form 1120, 1120-C, 1120-F, 1120-REIT, 1120-RIC, or 1120S. The form asks for information such as the name of the officer, their social security number, the percent of time devoted to the business, the percent of stock owned, and the amount of compensation. The form is only required to be completed if the total receipts of the company are $500,000 or more. The form also includes a section to report any compensation of officers that has already been claimed on Form 1125-A or elsewhere on the tax return. The form calculates the total compensation of officers by subtracting the claimed compensation from the total compensation reported. The result is then entered on Form 1120, page 1, line 12 or the appropriate line of the tax return.
