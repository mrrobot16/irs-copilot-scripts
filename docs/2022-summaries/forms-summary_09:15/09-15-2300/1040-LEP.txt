Schedule LEP (Form 1040) is a document that taxpayers can attach to their tax return to request a change in their language preference for written communications from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The form provides a list of languages, and taxpayers can select their preferred language by checking the appropriate box. The IRS is committed to providing taxpayers with limited English proficiency access to information about their taxpayer rights and responsibilities. However, it is important to note that translations in the requested language may not be immediately available, and taxpayers may continue to receive communications in English until they are translated. Schedule LEP is not mandatory but can be filed by taxpayers with limited English proficiency to indicate their language preference or change their language preference for IRS-issued written communications. The form should be filed with the taxpayer's income tax return. If the taxpayer e-files their tax return, they should not file the paper version of Schedule LEP. The form should be filed for each spouse on a joint return who prefers an alternative language. The taxpayer's Social Security Number (SSN) should be entered on the form, and if the taxpayer is a nonresident or resident alien without an SSN, they should apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) using Form W-7. The taxpayer should select one language from the listed options on Line 1 of the form, and their selection will be effective for future written communications from the IRS until it is changed or cancelled. Special assistance is available for individuals with limited English proficiency through programs sponsored by the IRS.
