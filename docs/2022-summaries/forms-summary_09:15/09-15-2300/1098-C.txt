Form 1098-C is a document used for reporting contributions of motor vehicles, boats, and airplanes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The form includes information about the donor, the donee, and the donated vehicle. It includes details such as the date of contribution, odometer mileage, make and model of the vehicle, and the vehicle identification number. The form also includes checkboxes for the donee to certify whether the vehicle was sold, whether it will be transferred for money or services, or whether it will be transferred to a needy individual. The form also includes information about any goods or services provided in exchange for the vehicle and the value of those goods or services. The form must be attached to the donor's federal tax return in order to claim a deduction for the contribution. Copies of the form are also provided to the donee and for the donor's records.
