Form 8038-G is an information return for tax-exempt governmental bonds. It is used to report details about the bond issue, such as the issuer's name, employer identification number (EIN), and contact information. The form also includes sections to describe the type of issue, the uses of the bond proceeds, and any refunding of prior bonds. There are also sections for miscellaneous information, such as state volume cap allocation, investments in guaranteed investment contracts (GICs), and pooled financings. The form requires the signature and consent of the issuer's authorized representative.
