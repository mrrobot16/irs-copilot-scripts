Form 8850 is a document used by job applicants and employers to determine eligibility for the Work Opportunity Credit. The form requires the job applicant to provide personal information, such as their name, social security number, address, and telephone number. The applicant must also check boxes indicating if they meet certain criteria, such as receiving assistance from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), being a veteran, or being unemployed for a certain period of time. The form also includes a section for the employer to complete, confirming that the applicant provided the information and requesting certification that the individual is a member of a targeted group. The form includes a privacy notice, explaining how the information will be used and disclosed, as well as information about the Paperwork Reduction Act. The estimated time to complete and file the form varies depending on individual circumstances.
