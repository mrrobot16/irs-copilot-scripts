Form 8845 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for individuals to claim the Indian Employment Credit on their tax return. The form requires the taxpayer to provide information about the total amount of qualified wages and qualified employee health insurance costs paid or incurred during the tax year. It also includes a section for taxpayers to report any qualified wages and health insurance costs from the calendar year 1993. 

The form calculates the incremental increase by subtracting the amount reported for calendar year 1993 from the total amount of qualified wages and health insurance costs. This incremental increase is then multiplied by 20% (0.20) to determine the Indian employment credit. 

The form also includes sections for reporting the Indian employment credit from partnerships, S corporations, cooperatives, estates, and trusts. Depending on the entity type, the taxpayer may need to report the credit on Schedule K or Form 3800. 

Cooperatives, estates, and trusts have an additional step of subtracting the amount allocated to patrons or beneficiaries before reporting the credit on Form 3800. 

Taxpayers are advised to refer to the instructions provided on the IRS website for more detailed information and guidance on completing Form 8845.
