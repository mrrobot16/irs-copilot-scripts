The document provides instructions and information for filing Forms W-2 and W-3 electronically. It states that these forms can be filed online on the SSA's Employer W-2 Filing Instructions and Information web page. The document also mentions that fill-in versions of the forms can be created for filing with the SSA, as well as printing copies for filing with state or local governments, distribution to employees, and record-keeping purposes.

It notes that Copy A of the form is for informational purposes only and is not scannable when printed from the website. It advises against printing and filing Copy A downloaded from the website with the SSA, as there may be penalties for filing non-scannable forms. The penalties section of the General Instructions for Forms W-2 and W-3 provides more information on this.

The document also provides instructions for ordering official IRS information returns, such as Forms W-2 and W-3, which include scannable Copy A for filing. It directs readers to the IRS Online Ordering for Information Returns and Employer Returns page or the IRS website for more information on ordering these forms.
