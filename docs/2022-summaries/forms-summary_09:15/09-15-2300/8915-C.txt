Form 8915-C is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for individuals to report their qualified 2018 disaster retirement plan distributions and repayments. This form should be attached to the individual's 2022 Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form includes two parts: Part I is for reporting qualified 2018 disaster distributions from retirement plans other than Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and Part II is for reporting qualified 2018 disaster distributions from Traditional, SEP, SIMPLE, and Roth IRAs.

In each part, the form asks for information such as the amounts reported on previous year's forms, excess repayments, repayments made before filing the 2022 tax return, and the amount subject to tax in 2022.

The form also includes sections for the individual to sign and declare the accuracy of the information provided.
