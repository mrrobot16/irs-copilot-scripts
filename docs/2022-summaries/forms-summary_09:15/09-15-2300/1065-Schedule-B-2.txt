Schedule B-2 is a form that is attached to Form 1065 or Form 1066 for certain partnerships with 100 or fewer partners to elect out of the centralized partnership audit regime. The form requires the partnership to list the eligible partners, including individuals, C corporations, foreign entities that would be treated as C corporations if they were domestic, S corporations, and estates of deceased partners. The form also requires the partnership to list the S corporation shareholders and their information. The total number of Schedules K-1 required to be issued is calculated, and if it exceeds 100, the partnership cannot make the election. The form includes continuation pages for listing additional eligible partners and S corporation shareholders.
