Form W-8BEN is a document issued by the Department of the Treasury's Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for individuals who are foreign beneficial owners and need to certify their foreign status for tax withholding and reporting purposes in the United States. This form should be given to the withholding agent or payer and should not be sent to the IRS.

The form provides instructions and the latest information on the IRS website at www.irs.gov/FormW8BEN. It is important to note that entities must use Form W-8BEN-E, and this form is only for use by individuals.

The form includes several sections for the identification of the beneficial owner, such as their name, country of citizenship, permanent residence address, and mailing address if different. It also asks for U.S. taxpayer identification number (SSN or ITIN) if required, foreign tax identifying number, reference numbers, and date of birth.

There is a section for claiming tax treaty benefits for chapter 3 purposes, where the beneficial owner can certify their residency within the meaning of the income tax treaty between the United States and their country. They can also specify special rates and conditions applicable to their situation.

The form concludes with a certification section where the individual declares, under penalties of perjury, that the information provided is true, correct, and complete. They confirm their status as the beneficial owner, that they are not a U.S. person, and specify the type of income this form relates to. They also authorize the form to be provided to withholding agents and agree to submit a new form if any certification becomes incorrect.

The form requires the signature of the beneficial owner or an individual authorized to sign on their behalf, along with the date and printed name of the signer.

It is important to refer to the separate instructions for the Paperwork Reduction Act Notice.

This summary provides a general overview of the Form W-8BEN. For detailed guidance and specific instructions, individuals should refer to the official form and consult with a tax professional if needed.
