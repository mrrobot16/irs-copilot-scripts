Schedule G (Form 8865) is a document used by taxpayers to report the application of the gain deferral method under Section 721(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. It is attached to Form 8865, which is used to report information about a foreign partnership.

- Part II: Remaining Built-in Gain, Remedial Income, and Gain Recognition: This section tracks the remaining built-in gain at the beginning and end of the tax year, as well as any remedial income allocated to the U.S. transferor and gain recognized due to acceleration events or section 367 transfers.

- Part III: Allocation Percentages of Partnership Items: This section allocates partnership items (income, gain, deduction, and loss) with respect to the Section 721(c) property to the U.S. transferor and related domestic and foreign partners.

- Part IV: Allocation of Items to U.S. Transferor: This section further breaks down the allocation of income, gain, deduction, and loss to the U.S. transferor with respect to the Section 721(c) property.
