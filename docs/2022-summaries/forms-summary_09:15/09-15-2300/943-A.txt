Form 943-A is a document used by agricultural employers to record their federal tax liability. It is filed along with Form 943 or Form 943-X. The form consists of a table with columns for each month of the year, where employers can enter their tax liability for each day of the month. The form also includes a section to calculate the total tax liability for each month and for the entire year. The form should be completed by semiweekly schedule depositors or those who have accumulated a tax liability of $100,000 or more in any given month.
