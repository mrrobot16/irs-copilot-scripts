Form 4684 is a document provided by the Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service for reporting casualties and thefts on a tax return. The form is used to report losses of personal-use property, business property, and income-producing property. It includes sections for providing details of the properties, their cost or basis, insurance or reimbursement, fair market value before and after the casualty or theft, and calculating the casualty or theft loss. The form also includes sections for reporting gains from casualties or thefts and deducting theft losses for Ponzi-type investment schemes. Additionally, there is a section for electing to deduct a federally declared disaster loss in the preceding tax year and a section for revoking a prior election. The form provides instructions and guidelines for completing each section.
