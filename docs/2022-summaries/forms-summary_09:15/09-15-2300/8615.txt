Form 8615 is a document issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the purpose of calculating the tax for certain children who have unearned income. The form is to be attached to the child's Form 1040 or 1040-NR. The form includes various sections and lines where specific information related to the child's income, deductions, and taxable income must be entered. The form also requires information about the parent's taxable income and filing status. The form provides calculations to determine the tentative tax based on the parent's tax rate and the child's tax based on their filing status. The form concludes with the final tax amount to be entered on the child's tax return. Detailed instructions and the latest information can be found on the IRS website.
