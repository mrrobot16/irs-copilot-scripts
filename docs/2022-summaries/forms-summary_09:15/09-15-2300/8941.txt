- Determining eligibility for the credit based on payment of premiums for employee health insurance coverage through a Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace.
- Providing identifying information, including the employer identification number (EIN).
- Checking if a previous tax return filed between 2013 and 2021 included a Form 8941 with a positive amount on line 12, which may affect eligibility for the credit.
- Completing worksheets to calculate the number of employees, full-time equivalent employees, average annual wages, and premiums paid for health insurance coverage.
- Calculating the credit amount based on the premiums paid and applying the applicable percentage (35% for tax-exempt small employers, 50% for all other small employers).
- Considering any state premium subsidies or tax credits available for the premiums paid.
- Determining the final credit amount and reporting it on the appropriate tax forms (Schedule K for partnerships and S corporations, Form 3800 for others).

The form also provides instructions for completing additional sections related to cooperatives, estates, trusts, and tax-exempt small employers.
