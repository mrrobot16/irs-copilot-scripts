Form 8866 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the purpose of interest computation under the Look-Back Method for property depreciated under the Income Forecast Method. The form requires the taxpayer to provide their identifying information, including their name, address, and taxpayer type (corporation, individual, estate or trust, S corporation, or partnership). If the taxpayer was an owner of an interest in a pass-through entity, they must also provide the name and employer identification number of the entity.

The form includes various sections for the recomputation year, prior years, and adjustments to taxable income. It requires the taxpayer to enter taxable income (or loss) for the prior years shown on their tax return, as well as adjustments to taxable income for the difference between depreciation deducted under the income forecast method and depreciation allowable based on actual income earned. The form also calculates income tax liability for the prior years and determines the increase or decrease in tax for which interest is due or to be refunded.

The form provides sections for the calculation of interest due on the increase in tax and interest to be refunded on the decrease in tax. It also determines the net amount of interest to be refunded or owed by the taxpayer. The form includes signature sections for the taxpayer and their spouse (if applicable), as well as a section for the preparer's information.

Form 8866 is to be filed separately and not attached to the taxpayer's tax return. The form includes a Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, and the latest instructions can be found on the IRS website.
