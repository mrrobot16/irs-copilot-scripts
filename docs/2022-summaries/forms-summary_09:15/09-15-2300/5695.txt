Form 5695 is a document provided by the Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service for claiming residential energy credits on your tax return. It consists of two parts: Part I for the Residential Clean Energy Credit and Part II for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit.

In Part I, you need to provide information on the costs of qualified energy property, such as solar electric property, solar water heating property, small wind energy property, geothermal heat pump property, and biomass fuel property. You calculate the credit by adding up the costs and multiplying it by 30%. There is also a section for qualified fuel cell property costs, where you determine the credit based on the cost and kilowatt capacity. The total credit amount is calculated by adding the various components and considering any credit carryforward from the previous year.

In Part II, you determine the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit. You indicate whether the qualified improvements were made to your main home located in the United States. If so, you provide the address and specify if the improvements were related to the construction of the home. The credit is calculated based on the costs of qualified energy efficiency improvements, such as insulation, doors, roof, windows, and skylights. There is also a section for residential energy property costs, including energy-efficient building property, furnace or hot water boiler, and main air circulating fan. The total credit amount is determined by adding up the various components and considering any lifetime limitation.

The final step is to compare the calculated credit amounts with the limitation based on tax liability. You enter the smaller of the two amounts as the residential clean energy credit or energy efficient home improvement credit, which should also be included on Schedule 3 of your tax return. Any unused credit can be carried forward to the following year.

It's important to refer to the instructions provided on the official IRS website for detailed guidance and the latest information.
