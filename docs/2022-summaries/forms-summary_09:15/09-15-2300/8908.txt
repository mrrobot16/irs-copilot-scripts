Form 8908 is a document provided by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for claiming the Energy Efficient Home Credit. The form should be attached to the taxpayer's tax return. The form includes various lines for entering information related to the number of qualified energy efficient homes sold or leased before and after 2022, and the corresponding credit amounts for each category. The total credit amount is calculated by adding up the credit amounts from each line. Partnerships and S corporations have specific instructions for reporting the credit amount. The form also provides a reference to the IRS website for instructions and the latest information.
