Form 5884-A is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for employers who have been affected by qualified disasters. The form is used to calculate the Employee Retention Credit for these employers. 

The form consists of several sections and lines that need to be filled out. 

In line 1a, employers affected by a 2018 through 2019 qualified disaster need to enter the total qualified wages paid or incurred during the applicable period while the business was inoperable. 

In line 1b, employers affected by a 2020 qualified disaster need to enter the total qualified wages paid or incurred during the applicable period while the business was inoperable. 

Line 1c is the sum of lines 1a and 1b. 

Line 2 requires employers to multiply line 1c by 40% (0.40). This calculation is used to determine the adjustment that needs to be made to the deduction for salaries and wages. 

Line 3 is for the employee retention credit from partnerships, S corporations, cooperatives, estates, and trusts. 

Line 4 is the sum of lines 2 and 3. Cooperatives, estates, and trusts need to proceed to line 5, while partnerships and S corporations can stop at this point and report this amount on Schedule K. All others need to stop at this point and report this amount on Form 3800, Part III, line 1aa. 

Line 5 is for the amount allocated to patrons of the cooperative or beneficiaries of the estate or trust. 

Line 6 is for cooperatives, estates, and trusts to subtract line 5 from line 4 and report this amount on Form 3800, Part III, line 1aa. 

The form includes references to instructions and the latest information, which can be found on the IRS website.
