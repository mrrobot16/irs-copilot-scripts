Form 8828 is a document used for the recapture of federal mortgage subsidy. It is attached to Form 1040 and requires information about the home subject to federally subsidized debt. The form asks for the address of the property, the type of federal subsidy received, the name of the bond or certificate issuer, and the original lending institution. It also asks for the date of closing of the original loan, the date of sale or disposition of the home, and the number of years and months between the original closing date and the sale or disposition date.

Part II of the form involves the computation of recapture tax. It asks for the sales price of the home, expenses of sale, and the adjusted basis of the home. It then calculates the gain or loss from the sale or disposition and multiplies it by 50%. The form also requires the taxpayer to provide their modified adjusted gross income and adjusted qualifying income. Based on these figures, the form calculates the income percentage and federally subsidized amount. It also includes a holding period percentage.

The form then multiplies the federally subsidized amount by the holding period percentage and calculates the recapture amount. The tax owed is the smaller of the recapture amount or the amount calculated by multiplying the gain or loss by 50%. This tax amount is to be included on the line for total tax on Form 1040.
