Form 720-CS is a document used for reporting carrier summary information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The form includes two parts: Part I is for providing carrier information such as company name, address, contact person, and contact details. Part II is for reporting transactions for the month, including total receipts and total deliveries for each product code (PC). The form also includes separate schedules (Schedule A and Schedule B) for reporting carrier receipts and carrier deliveries, respectively. These schedules require information such as consignor details, mode code, vessel official number (if applicable), document date, document number, and net gallons. The form must be signed and dated by the carrier, and the carrier's name, EIN, and Form 637 registration number must be provided.
