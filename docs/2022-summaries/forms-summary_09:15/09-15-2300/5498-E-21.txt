Form 5498-ESA is a document used to report contributions and rollover contributions made to a Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA). The form includes information about the trustee or issuer of the account, the beneficiary's information, and the account number. It also provides details on the contributions made for the specified year and any rollover contributions. The form is divided into three copies: Copy A is filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Copy B is provided to the beneficiary, and Copy C is for the trustee or issuer's records. The form includes instructions for both the beneficiary and the trustee or issuer on how to complete and file the form. The document also provides information on the beneficiary's taxpayer identification number (TIN), the account number, and the deadline for filing the form with the IRS. It also mentions the need to withdraw any excess contributions if the total contributions made to all Coverdell ESAs for the year exceeded $2,000. The form provides a website for the latest information and developments related to Form 5498-ESA and directs users to the IRS website for free online federal tax preparation options.
