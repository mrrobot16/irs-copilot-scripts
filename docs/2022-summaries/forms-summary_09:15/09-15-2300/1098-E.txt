This document is a Form 1098-E, which is a statement used for reporting student loan interest received by lenders. It is divided into three copies: Copy A is for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Copy B is for the borrower, and Copy C is for the recipient. The form includes fields for the recipient/lender's information, borrower's information, account number, and the amount of student loan interest received by the lender. There is also a checkbox to indicate if the loan origination fees and/or capitalized interest are not included in the reported amount. The document provides instructions for the borrower and recipient/lender on how to complete the form and where to find additional resources for assistance.
