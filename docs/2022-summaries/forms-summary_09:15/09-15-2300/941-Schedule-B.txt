Schedule B (Form 941) is a document used by employers to report their tax liability for each quarter. It is not used to show deposits made, but rather to show the amount of taxes owed. This form should be filled out and attached to Form 941 or Form 941-SS if the employer is a semiweekly schedule depositor or if their accumulated tax liability on any day was $100,000 or more. The form includes spaces to write the daily tax liability for each day of the month for three months. The total liability for the quarter should be filled in at the end of the form. This total should match line 12 on Form 941 or Form 941-SS.
