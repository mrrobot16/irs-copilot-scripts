Schedule 6 (Form 8849) is a document that needs to be attached to Form 8849 when filing for other claims with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The form requires the individual or business to provide their name, EIN or SSN, and the total refund amount. They also need to enter the earliest and latest dates of the events included in the claim.

The form provides space to list up to five different taxes being claimed, along with the amount of refund requested for each tax. The individual or business is also given space to provide an explanation for each tax claimed.

For claims made under section 6416(b)(2) relating to certain uses and resales of certain articles subject to manufacturers or retailers taxes, the claimant must certify that they sold the article at a tax-excluded price, repaid the tax amount to the ultimate vendor, or have obtained written consent from the ultimate vendor to make the claim. They must also have the required supporting evidence.

The form includes a notice for Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act, and directs individuals to visit the IRS website for more information and instructions on completing Schedule 6 (Form 8849).
