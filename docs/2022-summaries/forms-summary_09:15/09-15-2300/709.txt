Form 709 is the United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return. It is used to report gifts made during the calendar year and calculate any gift tax owed. The form requires general information about the donor, including their name, address, social security number, and citizenship. If the donor is deceased or has changed their address since filing a previous Form 709, additional information is required. The form also includes sections for gifts made by a spouse, computation of gift tax, reconciliation of taxable gifts, and computation of generation-skipping transfer tax. The form must be signed by the donor under penalties of perjury.
