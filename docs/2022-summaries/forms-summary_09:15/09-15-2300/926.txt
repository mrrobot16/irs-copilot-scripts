Form 926 is a document that must be attached to an income tax return when a U.S. transferor of property makes a transfer to a foreign corporation. The form requires information about the transferor, including whether they are a specified 10%-owned foreign corporation and if they remain in existence after the transfer. It also asks about basis adjustments, partnerships, and whether any cash or other property was transferred. The form also requests information about the transferee foreign corporation, including its name, identifying number, address, and whether it is a controlled foreign corporation. The form includes sections for reporting the transfer of different types of property, such as cash, stock and securities, inventory, and intangible property subject to section 367(d). Additional information is requested regarding the transfer, such as the transferor's interest in the transferee foreign corporation, the type of nonrecognition transaction, and whether the transfer resulted from a change in entity classification. The form also asks about certain specific situations, such as distributions of property covered by section 367(e)(2) and section 355 distributions of stock in a foreign controlled corporation covered by section 367(e)(1).
