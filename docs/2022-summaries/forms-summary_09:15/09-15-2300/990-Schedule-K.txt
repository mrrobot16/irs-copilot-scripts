Schedule K is a supplemental information form that organizations need to complete if they answered "Yes" to a specific question on Form 990, Part IV, line 24a. It provides additional details and explanations related to tax-exempt bonds. The form consists of several parts:

Part I: Bond Issues
This section requires the organization to provide information about the bond issues, including the issuer name, issuer EIN, CUSIP number, date issued, issue price, purpose, whether the bonds are defeased, and whether they are issued on behalf of the issuer or as part of pooled financing.

Part II: Proceeds
In this part, the organization needs to report various details about the proceeds from the bond issues, such as the amount of retired bonds, legally defeased bonds, total proceeds of the issue, gross proceeds in reserve funds, capitalized interest from proceeds, proceeds in refunding escrows, issuance costs from proceeds, credit enhancement from proceeds, working capital expenditures from proceeds, capital expenditures from proceeds, and other spent and unspent proceeds.

Part III: Private Business Use
