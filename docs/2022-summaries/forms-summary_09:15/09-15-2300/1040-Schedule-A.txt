Schedule A (Form 1040) is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that is used for itemized deductions on a tax return. The form includes various sections for different types of deductions.

The document begins with instructions to visit the IRS website for additional guidance and information. It is to be attached to either Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR.

The first section of the form is for Medical and Dental Expenses. It instructs taxpayers not to include expenses that have been reimbursed or paid by others. It provides space to enter the amount of medical and dental expenses and calculates the deduction based on a percentage of adjusted gross income.

The next section is for Taxes Paid, including state and local taxes. It provides space to enter state and local income taxes or general sales taxes, real estate taxes, and personal property taxes. It also includes a limit for the deduction based on a maximum amount.

The following section is for Interest Paid, specifically for home mortgage interest and points. It provides space to enter mortgage interest and points reported on Form 1098, as well as any other home mortgage interest and points not reported on Form 1098. It also includes a section for investment interest, with instructions to attach Form 4952 if required.

The next section is for Gifts to Charity. It includes separate spaces for gifts made by cash or check, as well as gifts made other than by cash or check. It also mentions the requirement to attach Form 8283 if the total gift amount exceeds $500.

The form then includes a section for Carryover from prior year, which allows taxpayers to deduct any unused deductions from previous years.

The next section is for Casualty and Theft Losses, specifically for losses from federally declared disasters. It instructs taxpayers to attach Form 4684 and enter the amount from line 18 of that form.

Finally, the form includes a section for Other Itemized Deductions, allowing taxpayers to list any additional deductions not covered in the previous sections.

The form concludes with a total for all itemized deductions, which is to be entered on Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR, and a checkbox for taxpayers who choose to itemize deductions even if they are less than the standard deduction.

Overall, Schedule A (Form 1040) provides a structured format for taxpayers to report and calculate their itemized deductions on their tax return.
