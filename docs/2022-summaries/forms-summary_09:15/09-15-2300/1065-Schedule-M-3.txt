Schedule M-3 is a form that must be attached to Form 1065 for certain partnerships. It is used to reconcile the net income (loss) of the partnership per its income statement with the income (loss) per its tax return. The form includes sections for financial information, net income (loss) reconciliation, and reconciliation of income (loss) items and expense/deduction items. The form also includes checkboxes to indicate the reasons for filing Schedule M-3, such as the partnership's total assets, adjusted total assets, or total receipts meeting certain thresholds, or if there is a reportable entity partner with a significant ownership interest. The form provides specific lines for entering various income and expense items, as well as adjustments and reconciliations. The form must be completed accurately to ensure consistency between the partnership's income statement and its tax return.
