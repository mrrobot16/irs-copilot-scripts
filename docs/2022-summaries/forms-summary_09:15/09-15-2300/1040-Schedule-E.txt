Schedule E (Form 1040) is a document used to report supplemental income and loss from various sources such as rental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, estates, trusts, and REMICs. It is attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, 1040-NR, or 1041.

Part I of the form is used to report income or loss from rental real estate and royalties. It includes sections to report payments that require filing Form(s) 1099 and whether the required Form(s) 1099 have been filed. It also includes spaces to provide the physical address and type of property for each rental real estate property, as well as the number of fair rental and personal use days.

The total expenses are then subtracted from the rents and royalties received to determine the income or loss.
