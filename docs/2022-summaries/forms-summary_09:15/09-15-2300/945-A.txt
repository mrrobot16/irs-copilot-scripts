Form 945-A is an annual record of federal tax liability that needs to be completed by semiweekly schedule depositors or those who have accumulated a tax liability of $100,000 or more during any month. The form is used to report the tax liability for each month of the calendar year. The form consists of a table with columns for each month where the taxpayer can enter their tax liability for each day of the month. The total tax liability for each month is calculated, and at the end of the form, the total tax liability for the year is calculated by adding up the monthly totals. This total must match line 3 on Form 945 (line 19 on Form CT-1, line 9 on Form 944). The form includes instructions and a link to the IRS website for more information.
