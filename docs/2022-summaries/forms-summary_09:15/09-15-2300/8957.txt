Form 8957 is a document used for the registration of financial institutions under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). It is important to complete all sections of the form and sign it, otherwise it will not be processed. The form should be mailed to the designated address in Austin, Texas. The form includes sections for providing information about the financial institution, such as its type, name, country/jurisdiction of residence, and tax ID. It also asks for the financial institution's FATCA classification, mailing address, and whether it has a withholding agreement with the IRS as a Qualified Intermediary, Withholding Foreign Partnership, or Withholding Foreign Trust. The form also asks if the financial institution maintains a branch outside of its country/jurisdiction of tax residence, and if so, to provide details about those branches. The form requires the designation of a FATCA Responsible Officer (RO) for the financial institution, including their business title, name, address, telephone number, fax number, and email address. The RO is also given the option to designate additional points of contact (POCs) for the financial institution, and their information should be provided as well. If the financial institution is part of an Expanded Affiliated Group, additional information about the group's members and common parent entity is required. The form concludes with a signature section where the person completing the form certifies the accuracy and completeness of the information provided.
