Form 4136 is a document provided by the Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service for taxpayers to claim a credit for federal tax paid on fuels. The form includes different sections for claiming credits for various types of fuel usage, such as gasoline, aviation gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, alternative fuel, biodiesel, and more. Each section requires the taxpayer to provide information on the type of use, rate, gallons, amount of credit, and credit reference number. The form also includes sections for sales by registered ultimate vendors and registered credit card issuers. The total income tax credit claimed is calculated by adding up the credits claimed in each section. The form provides instructions and cautions for each section, and taxpayers are advised to refer to the IRS website for the latest information and instructions.
