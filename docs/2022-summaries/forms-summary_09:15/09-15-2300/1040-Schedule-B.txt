Schedule B (Form 1040) is a document provided by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for reporting interest and ordinary dividends. It is to be attached to Form 1040 or 1040-SR. The form includes three parts.

Part I: Interest
This section is used to report interest income. If the taxpayer received a Form 1099-INT, Form 1099-OID, or substitute statement from a brokerage firm, they should list the firm's name as the payer and enter the total interest shown on that form. The taxpayer should also list any interest from a seller-financed mortgage where the property was used as a personal residence.

Part II: Ordinary Dividends
This section is used to report ordinary dividend income. If the taxpayer received a Form 1099-DIV or substitute statement from a brokerage firm, they should list the firm's name as the payer and enter the ordinary dividends shown on that form.

Part III: Foreign Accounts and Trusts
This section is required if the taxpayer had over $1,500 of taxable interest or ordinary dividends, had a foreign account, or received a distribution from, or were a grantor of, or a transferor to, a foreign trust. It asks if the taxpayer had a financial interest in or signature authority over a financial account located in a foreign country, and if so, whether they are required to file FinCEN Form 114 (FBAR) to report that financial interest or signature authority. It also asks if the taxpayer received a distribution from, or were the grantor of, or transferor to, a foreign trust, which may require filing Form 3520.

The form provides space for the taxpayer to enter the necessary information and calculate the totals, which are then transferred to Form 1040 or 1040-SR. If certain thresholds are met, additional forms may need to be completed.

It is important for taxpayers to review the instructions and the latest information on the IRS website (www.irs.gov/ScheduleB) for complete guidance on how to fill out Schedule B.
