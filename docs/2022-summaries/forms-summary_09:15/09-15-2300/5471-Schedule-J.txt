Schedule J (Form 5471) is a document used to report the Accumulated Earnings & Profits (E&P) of a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC). It is attached to Form 5471, which is filed with the Department of the Treasury's Internal Revenue Service. The form requires the name of the person filing, their identifying number, the name of the foreign corporation, and its Employer Identification Number (EIN), if applicable.

Part I of the form is used to report the accumulated E&P of the CFC. It requires the person filing to enter amounts in the functional currency. The form includes various categories and codes to be filled in, as well as a box to check if the person filing does not have all the necessary information from U.S. shareholders to complete a specific amount.

Part II of the form is used to report nonpreviously taxed E&P subject to recapture as Subpart F income, as defined by section 952(c)(2). It requires the person filing to enter the balance at the beginning of the year, additions subject to future recapture, subtractions recaptured in the current year, and the balance at the end of the year.
