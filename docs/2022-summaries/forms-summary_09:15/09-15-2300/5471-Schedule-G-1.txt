Schedule G-1 is a form that needs to be attached to Form 5471 for reporting a Cost Sharing Arrangement (CSA) involving a foreign corporation. The form requires the filer to provide information such as a description of the CSA, whether the foreign corporation became a participant in the CSA during the tax year, and the foreign corporation's share of reasonably anticipated benefits for the CSA. It also asks about platform contributions made by a U.S. taxpayer, stock-based compensation deductions, and intangible development costs. The form must be completed separately for each CSA in which the foreign corporation participated during the tax year. All amounts should be reported in U.S. dollars.
