Schedule D (Form 1065) is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for reporting capital gains and losses. It should be attached to Form 1065 or Form 8865. The form instructs taxpayers to use Form 8949 to list their transactions for specific lines on Schedule D. The form provides spaces to enter information such as proceeds, cost or other basis, adjustments to gain or loss, and calculates the net gain or loss for both short-term and long-term transactions. The form also includes sections for reporting capital gain distributions and the partnership's share of net capital gains or losses from other partnerships, estates, and trusts. If the partnership disposed of any investments in a qualified opportunity fund during the tax year, additional reporting requirements apply. The form provides instructions and directs taxpayers to the IRS website for more information and the latest updates.
