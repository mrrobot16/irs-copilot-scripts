Part II is for reporting ordinary gains and losses not included in other sections. It includes lines for reporting loss from Part I, gain from Part I or from prior years, and net gain or loss.

Part III is for reporting gain from the disposition of property under specific sections of the tax code. It includes columns for describing the property, dates of acquisition and sale, gross sales price, cost or other basis, depreciation allowed or allowable, adjusted basis, and total gain.

Part IV is for reporting recapture amounts under sections 179 and 280F(b)(2) when the business use of property drops to 50% or less. It includes lines for reporting the section 179 expense deduction or depreciation allowed in prior years, recomputed depreciation, and the recapture amount.
