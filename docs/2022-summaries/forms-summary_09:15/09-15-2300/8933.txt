Form 8933 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for claiming the Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit. The form is used to report information about the capture, disposal, and utilization of qualified carbon oxide, as well as any elections made by taxpayers regarding the credit. 

The form is divided into several parts. Part I requires the taxpayer to provide basic information about themselves. Part II is used to report the capture, disposal, and utilization of qualified carbon oxide for facilities that were placed in service before February 9, 2018. Part III is used for facilities placed in service on or after February 9, 2018, and for which no election was made. 

Part IV is specifically for qualified direct air capture facilities placed in service after 2022. Part V is for providing other relevant information, such as making elections under specific sections, reporting carbon oxide sequestration credit claimed by another taxpayer, and reporting any recaptured credit. 

The form also includes instructions for completing the form and attaching the necessary model certificates for each category of qualified carbon oxide. The form is to be attached to the taxpayer's tax return.
