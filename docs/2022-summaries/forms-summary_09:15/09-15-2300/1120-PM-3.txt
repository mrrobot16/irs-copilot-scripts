Schedule M-3 (Form 1120-PC) is a form used by U.S. property and casualty insurance companies with total assets of $10 million or more to reconcile their net income (loss) for tax purposes with their financial statements. The form is divided into three parts.

Part I requires the company to provide financial information and reconcile its net income (loss) per its income statement with its tax return. The company must indicate whether it filed SEC Form 10-K, prepared a certified audited non-tax-basis income statement, or prepared a non-tax-basis income statement. It also includes sections for restatements, information on publicly traded stock, and the accounting standard used.

Part II focuses on the reconciliation of net income (loss) per the income statement of includible corporations with taxable income per the tax return. It includes various income (loss) items such as income from equity method foreign corporations, foreign dividends, subpart F income, and more.

Part III deals with the reconciliation of net income (loss) per the income statement of includible corporations with taxable income per the tax return for expense and deduction items. It includes items such as income tax expenses, stock option expenses, meals and entertainment expenses, depreciation, interest expenses, and more.

The form provides instructions and space for attaching statements and explanations for various items. The totals from Part II and Part III must match with the amounts reported on other tax forms.

Overall, Schedule M-3 helps insurance companies reconcile their financial statements with their tax returns and ensure compliance with tax regulations.
