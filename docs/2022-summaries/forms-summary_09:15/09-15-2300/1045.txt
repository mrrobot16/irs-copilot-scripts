Form 1045 is an application for a tentative refund of taxes for individuals, estates, and trusts. It is used to carry back a net operating loss, unused general business credit, or net section 1256 contracts loss to a previous tax year. The form requires the filer to provide their personal information, including name, social security number, and address. It also asks for details about the tax year in question, such as the date the tax return was filed and whether a petition has been filed in Tax Court. The form includes a computation of the decrease in tax before and after the carryback, as well as information on credits, deductions, and other taxes. The form must be signed under penalties of perjury.
