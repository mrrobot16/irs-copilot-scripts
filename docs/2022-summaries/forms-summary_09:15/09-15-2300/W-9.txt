Form W-9 is a document used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to collect taxpayer identification numbers (TINs) from individuals and entities. The form includes sections for providing personal information, such as name and address, as well as tax classification and exemption codes. The form also includes a certification section where the taxpayer certifies their TIN, exemption from backup withholding, and U.S. citizenship or residency status. The form is used by the IRS to ensure accurate reporting of income and to determine if backup withholding or other tax requirements apply.
