Schedule R (Form 1040) is a document that taxpayers can use to claim the Credit for the Elderly or the Disabled. This credit can help reduce the amount of tax owed if certain conditions are met. The document provides instructions and a worksheet to help taxpayers determine if they are eligible for the credit and how much they can claim. The document includes different sections for taxpayers with different filing statuses and ages. It also includes a section for taxpayers to report their disability status and income. The document concludes with a calculation to determine the amount of the credit and where to report it on the tax return.
