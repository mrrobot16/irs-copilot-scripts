Form 965-C is a document used by the Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service to facilitate the transfer of tax liabilities under Section 965(h). The form requires information about the transferor and transferee, including their names, taxpayer identification numbers, and addresses. It also asks for details about the acceleration event that triggered the transfer agreement, such as a liquidation or sale of assets. The form includes sections for reporting the unpaid tax liability being assumed by the transferee and assessing their ability to make remaining payments. The agreement also outlines the terms and conditions of the transfer, including joint and several liability for the transferor and any successors. Both the transferor and transferee must sign the form under penalties of perjury.
