Schedule M-3 (Form 1120-F) is a document used by foreign corporations with reportable assets of $10 million or more to reconcile their net income (loss) per income statement with their taxable income per return. The form consists of three parts.

Part I requires the corporation to provide financial information and net income (loss) reconciliation. It includes questions about whether the corporation reported taxable income using a treaty provision, whether certified audited income statements were prepared, and whether certified audited income statements were prepared for the set(s) of books reported on Form 1120-F, Schedule L.

Part II involves the reconciliation of net income (loss) per income statement with taxable income per return. It includes a list of income (loss) items, temporary differences, permanent differences, and other permanent differences for allocations to non-ECI (effectively connected income) and ECI. The corporation must provide the amounts for each item and calculate the total income (loss) items.

Part III focuses on the reconciliation of net income (loss) per income statement with taxable income per return for expense/deduction items. It includes a list of expense items, temporary differences, permanent differences, and other permanent differences for allocations to non-ECI and ECI. The corporation must provide the amounts for each item and calculate the total expense/deduction items.

The form must be attached to Form 1120-F, and further instructions can be found on the IRS website.
