Form 8857 is a document used to request innocent spouse relief from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Innocent spouse relief is available to taxpayers who believe they should not be held responsible for tax, interest, or penalties from a joint tax return due to the actions or omissions of their spouse or former spouse.

The form provides important information and instructions for completing it. It emphasizes that the form should not be filed with a tax return and provides a website for accessing the latest instructions and information. It also states that any requested supporting documents should be attached to the form.

The form informs taxpayers that the IRS is required by law to notify the person listed on line 6 (the spouse or former spouse) that innocent spouse relief has been requested. This person will have the opportunity to participate in the process by completing a questionnaire about the tax years for which relief is sought.

The form also advises taxpayers that if they petition the Tax Court to review their request for relief, the court may only consider information provided before the IRS made its final determination, additional information included in the administrative file, and any newly discovered or previously unavailable information. Therefore, it is important for taxpayers to provide all relevant information.

The form includes several sections for taxpayers to provide their personal information, such as their name, social security number, address, and contact information. It also asks for information about the spouse or former spouse, including their current name, social security number, and contact information.

The form includes questions about the taxpayer's situation, such as whether they qualify for innocent spouse relief, whether the IRS has taken their share of a joint refund to pay past-due debts, and the tax years for which relief is sought. It also asks about the taxpayer's involvement in preparing the joint tax returns, their knowledge of the spouse's income and any missing or incorrect information on the returns, and their financial situation.

The form concludes with a section for taxpayers to provide any additional information they want the IRS to consider and an option to request a refund if they qualify for relief and have already paid the tax.

The form must be signed by the taxpayer under penalties of perjury, and there is a section for preparer information if applicable.
