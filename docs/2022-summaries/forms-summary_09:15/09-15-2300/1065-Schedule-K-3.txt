It is used for tax purposes and provides information about the partnership and the partner. The form is divided into several parts, each addressing specific information or sections that may apply to the partnership and partner. These parts include information about the partnership's employer identification number, name, address, and partner's social security number or taxpayer identification number. There are also sections for indicating which parts of the schedule apply and attaching the relevant information. The form also includes sections for reporting the partner's share of partnership income, deductions, credits, and other information related to international transactions, foreign tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income, foreign taxes, and more. Additionally, there are sections for reporting distributions from foreign corporations to the partnership, partner's interest in foreign corporation income, and base erosion and anti-abuse tax information. The form also includes sections for reporting foreign partners' character and source of income and deductions, as well as information related to section 871(m) covered partnerships and deemed sale items on the transfer of partnership interest.
