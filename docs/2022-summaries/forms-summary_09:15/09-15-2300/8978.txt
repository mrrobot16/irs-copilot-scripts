Form 8978 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for partners to report additional taxes for a specific year. The form includes three parts: Part I, which involves the computation of additional reporting year tax; Part II, which relates to penalties; and Part III, which pertains to interest. The form requires partners to provide information such as their names, tax ID numbers, and the source of review year adjustments (either BBA Audit or AAR Filing). Partners must also calculate their corrected income, deductions, taxable income, income tax, alternative minimum tax, credits, income tax liability, and the increase/decrease to their reporting year tax. Additionally, the form includes sections for reporting penalties and interest. The form provides space to enter amounts for each category and columns for different tax years and adjustments. The latest instructions and information for Form 8978 can be found on the IRS website.
