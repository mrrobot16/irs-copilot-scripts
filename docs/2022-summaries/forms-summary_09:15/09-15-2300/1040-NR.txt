The document is Schedule NEC (Form 1040-NR) for the year 2022, which is used to report and calculate the tax on income that is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. It is an attachment to Form 1040-NR. The schedule provides different categories of income, such as dividends, interest, royalties, pensions, and annuities, and specifies the applicable tax rates for each category. It also includes a section for reporting capital gains and losses from property sales or exchanges that are not effectively connected with a U.S. business. The schedule provides columns for entering the relevant information for each category of income or capital gain/loss, and calculates the total tax on income not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. The resulting tax amount is then entered on Form 1040-NR, line 23a.
