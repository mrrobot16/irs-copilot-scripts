Part 2 requires the customer to provide their employer identification number (EIN), name, trade name (if any), and address. The customer is also asked to identify the forms that the CPEO will file to report wages or compensation paid to employees.

Part 3 requires the CPEO to provide their EIN, name, trade name (if any), and address.

Part 4 asks for information about the relationship between the CPEO and the customer, including whether the relationship is subject to a CPEO contract, whether the customer is a provider of employment-related services, and whether the customer is a related party of the CPEO.

Part 5 is for the customer to sign and certify the accuracy of the information provided in the form.

Part 6 is for the CPEO to sign and certify the accuracy of the information provided in the form.

The form also includes a section for the CPEO to consent to the disclosure of tax information to the customer.
