Form 8915-B is a document provided by the Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for reporting qualified 2017 disaster retirement plan distributions and repayments. It is to be attached to the taxpayer's 2021 Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR.

The form includes sections for reporting qualified 2017 disaster distributions from retirement plans other than IRAs, as well as from traditional, SEP, SIMPLE, and Roth IRAs. It requires the taxpayer to provide information on the amounts carried back to prior years, excess repayments from 2020, and any repayments made in 2021.

The form also includes a signature section where the taxpayer can declare the accuracy and completeness of the form. There is a separate section for paid preparers to provide their information.

It is important to note that this form is specific to qualified 2017 disaster distributions and repayments and should not be used for reporting repayments of qualified 2018, 2019, or 2020 disaster distributions.
