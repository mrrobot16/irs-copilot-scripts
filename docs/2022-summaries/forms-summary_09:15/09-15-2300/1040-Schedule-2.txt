Schedule 2 (Form 1040) is an additional tax form that needs to be attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. It includes two parts: Part I for taxes and Part II for other taxes.

In Part I, taxpayers need to report alternative minimum tax and excess advance premium tax credit repayment. The total of these taxes should be entered on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 17.

Part II includes various other taxes that may apply to the taxpayer. These include self-employment tax, social security and Medicare tax on unreported tip income, uncollected social security and Medicare tax on wages, additional tax on IRAs or other tax-favored accounts, household employment taxes, repayment of first-time homebuyer credit, additional Medicare tax, net investment income tax, and more. Each applicable tax should be reported separately, and the total should be entered on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 23, or Form 1040-NR, line 23b.

The form also provides space to list any other additional taxes not covered in the provided categories. There is a section for Section 965 net tax liability installment from Form 965-A. Finally, there is a reserved section for future use.

Taxpayers should attach the necessary forms and schedules mentioned in the instructions, and for the latest information and instructions, they can visit the IRS website.
