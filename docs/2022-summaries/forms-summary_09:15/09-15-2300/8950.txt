Form 8950 is an application form used for the Voluntary Correction Program (VCP) under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS). It is filed electronically only on Pay.gov. The form requires the plan sponsor's information, including name, address, employer identification number, and contact details. It also asks for details about the type of VCP submission, the plan, qualification failures, and corrective measures. The form must be signed and dated by an authorized employee or the plan sponsor. The Procedural Requirements Checklist provides a list of items to include with the submission to ensure completeness.
