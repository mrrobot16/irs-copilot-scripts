Form 6765 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim the Credit for Increasing Research Activities. The form consists of several sections where taxpayers can input various amounts and calculations related to their research expenses.

Section A is for taxpayers who are not electing or revoking the alternative simplified credit. It includes fields for certain amounts paid or incurred to energy consortia, basic research payments to qualified organizations, qualified organization base period amount, wages for qualified services, cost of supplies, rental or lease costs of computers, and other calculations. The form guides taxpayers through the process of calculating their total qualified research expenses and determining the credit amount.

Section B is for taxpayers who are completing the alternative simplified credit. It includes similar fields as Section A, but with different calculations.

Section C is for taxpayers to report the current year credit, including any portion of the credit attributable to wages used in calculating the credit in Section A or B.

Section D is for qualified small businesses electing the payroll tax credit. It includes fields for the portion of the credit elected as a payroll tax credit, general business credit carryforward, and the final credit amount to be reported on Form 8974.

The form also provides instructions and references to additional information on the IRS website.
