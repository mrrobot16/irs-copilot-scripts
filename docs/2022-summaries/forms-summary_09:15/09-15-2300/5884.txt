Form 5884 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim the Work Opportunity Credit. This credit is available for employers who hire individuals from certain targeted groups. 

The form consists of several sections and lines where the taxpayer needs to enter specific information. 

Lines 1a, 1b, and 1c require the taxpayer to enter the total qualified wages paid or incurred during the tax year for employees who are certified as members of a targeted group. Each line has a corresponding percentage that needs to be multiplied by the wages entered. 

Line 2 instructs the taxpayer to add the amounts from lines 1a, 1b, and 1c and refers them to the instructions for any necessary adjustments to their deduction for salaries and wages. 

Line 3 is for taxpayers who are claiming the work opportunity credit from partnerships, S corporations, cooperatives, estates, and trusts. They need to enter the appropriate amount here. 

Line 4 instructs the taxpayer to add the amounts from lines 2 and 3. Depending on the type of entity, further instructions are provided on where to report this amount. 

Line 5 is for cooperatives, estates, and trusts to enter the amount allocated to their patrons or beneficiaries. 

Line 6 instructs cooperatives, estates, and trusts to subtract the amount from line 5 from the amount on line 4. This resulting amount needs to be reported on Form 3800, Part III, line 4b. 

The form also includes a reference to the Paperwork Reduction Act Notice, which provides additional information about the collection of information on the form.
