The form also accounts for reductions for state and local taxes and certified foreign partner-level items. The worksheet provides calculations for both the Adjusted Seasonal Installment Method and the Annualized Income Installment Method. The final section of the form calculates the required installment payments based on the calculations from the previous sections.
