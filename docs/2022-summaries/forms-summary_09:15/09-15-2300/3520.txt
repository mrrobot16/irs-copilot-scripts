Form 3520 is an annual return that individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusts, and executors of estates must file to report transactions with foreign trusts and the receipt of certain foreign gifts. The form must be filed separately for each foreign trust. The form requires individuals to provide identifying information, such as their name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN). It also asks for information about the foreign trust, including its name, address, and date of creation. The form includes sections for reporting transfers to a foreign trust, ownership of a foreign trust, distributions from a foreign trust, and gifts or bequests received from foreign persons. The form also includes schedules for reporting obligations of a related trust and calculating the interest charge on accumulation distributions. The form must be filed in English and all amounts must be reported in U.S. dollars. Additional instructions and the latest information can be found on the IRS website.
