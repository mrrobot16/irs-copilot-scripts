Form 945-X is a form used by employers to correct administrative errors made on Form 945, which is the Annual Return of Withheld Federal Income Tax. The form requires the employer to provide their employer identification number (EIN), name, address, and other relevant information. The form has four parts: Part 1 allows the employer to select the process they are using to correct the errors, either through an adjusted return or a claim for refund. Part 2 requires the employer to enter the corrections for the calendar year they are correcting. Part 3 requires a detailed explanation of how the corrections were determined. Part 4 is the declaration section, where the employer must sign and declare that the information provided is true, correct, and complete. The form must be completed and signed by the employer.
