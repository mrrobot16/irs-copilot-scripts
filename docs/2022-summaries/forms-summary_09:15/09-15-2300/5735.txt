Form 5735 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for corporations to claim the American Samoa Economic Development Credit. The form must be attached to the corporation's tax return. The form requires the corporation to meet the qualified production activities income requirement in order to qualify for the credit. The form includes several lines for entering different percentages of qualified compensation and depreciation deductions for short-life, medium-life, and long-life qualified tangible property. The form calculates a tentative credit by adding the amounts entered on lines 1 through 4. The total U.S. income tax against which the credit is allowed is entered on line 6. The American Samoa economic development credit is then determined by entering the smaller amount between line 5 and line 6 on line 7. The form includes a section for the Paperwork Reduction Act Notice.
