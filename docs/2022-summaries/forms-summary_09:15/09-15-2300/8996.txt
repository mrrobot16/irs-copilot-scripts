Form 8996 is a document issued by the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It is used by taxpayers who are organized for the purpose of investing in qualified opportunity zone (QOZ) property. The form includes several parts that require the taxpayer to provide information about their QOZ investments and calculate their investment standard and any potential penalties.

Part I of the form asks for general information about the taxpayer and whether they are organized for investing in QOZ property. If it is their first period as a QOZ, they must provide additional information about their organizing documents.

Part II involves the calculation of the investment standard, which is determined by dividing the total value of QOZ property held by the taxpayer by their total assets.

Part III determines whether the taxpayer has met the investment standard or not. If they have not, they must complete Part IV to calculate the penalty.

Part V and Part VI require the taxpayer to provide details about the QOZ business property directly owned or leased by them and the QOZ stock or partnership interests they hold.

Finally, Part VII is a continuation of Part VI for taxpayers who have investments in QOZ businesses located in multiple QOZs.

The form provides instructions for each part and includes spaces for the taxpayer to enter the necessary information. It must be attached to the taxpayer's tax return.
