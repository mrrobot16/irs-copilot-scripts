Form 945 is an annual return form used to report withheld federal income tax for withholding reported on Forms 1099 and W-2G. The form includes sections for providing employer identification number (EIN), trade name, and address. It also includes fields for reporting federal income tax withheld from pensions, annuities, IRAs, gambling winnings, and backup withholding. The form calculates the total taxes and total deposits for the year, and determines the balance due or overpayment. There are options to apply the overpayment to the next return or request a refund. The form also includes a section for monthly summary of federal tax liability. Additionally, there is a section for designating a third-party to discuss the return with the IRS. The form must be signed and dated by the taxpayer or preparer. The document also includes instructions for completing Form 945-V, which is a payment voucher used when making a payment with Form 945. The voucher includes fields for entering the employer identification number (EIN), payment amount, business name, address, and payment details. The voucher should be detached and sent with the payment and Form 945 to the provided address.
