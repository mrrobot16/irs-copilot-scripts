Form 965-E is a consent agreement form issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under Section 965(i)(4)(D). The form is used to request consent to make a Section 965(h) election, which relates to the taxation of certain foreign income.

The form requires the shareholder to provide their personal information, including their name, taxpayer identification number, and address. It also requires identifying information of the S Corporation for which the Section 965(i) election was in effect.

The shareholder is then required to provide details of the triggering event that gave rise to the need for consent, as well as the amount of the section 965(i) net tax liability remaining unpaid.

The form also asks whether the shareholder is able to make the payments required under Section 965(h) and if their leverage ratio exceeded 3:1 immediately after the triggering event. Additional information regarding the shareholder's ability to pay may also be provided.

By signing the form, the shareholder agrees to comply with the conditions and requirements of Section 965(h) and Regulations section 1.965-7(b), and to provide any additional information requested by the Commissioner. The form also states that if the consent agreement contains a material misrepresentation or omission, the Commissioner may reject the agreement.

The form must be signed by the shareholder and includes a declaration under penalties of perjury. The shareholder is required to provide their name, title, email address, and daytime phone number.

The form is to be filed in duplicate and the instructions should be referred to for information on when and where to file the form.
