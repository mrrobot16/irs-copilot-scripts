Schedule J (Form 1040) is used for income averaging for farmers and fishermen. It is an attachment to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. The form includes various lines for entering taxable income, elected farm income, capital gains, and other calculations. It provides instructions for calculating tax using the 2022, 2019, 2020, and 2021 tax rates. The form also includes lines for entering tax amounts from previous years' Schedule J forms. The final line calculates the tax amount to be included on Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. It is important to note that using the 2022 Tax Table, Tax Computation Worksheet, Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet, or Schedule D Tax Worksheet may result in a lower tax amount.
