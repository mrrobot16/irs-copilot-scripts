Form 2210-F is a document issued by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It is used to calculate and report any underpayment of estimated tax by farmers and fishermen. Generally, taxpayers do not need to file Form 2210-F as the IRS will calculate any penalties owed and send a bill. However, taxpayers can still use the form to calculate their penalty if they choose. Part I of the form includes reasons for filing, such as requesting a waiver or filing a joint return for only one of the two applicable years. Part II instructs taxpayers on how to calculate their underpayment, including entering their tax after credits, other taxes, refundable credits, and current year tax. Part III is used to calculate the penalty, which is based on the underpayment and the number of days it occurred. The calculated penalty amount is then entered on the taxpayer's tax return.
