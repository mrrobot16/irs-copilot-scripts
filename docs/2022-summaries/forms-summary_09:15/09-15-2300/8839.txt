Form 8839 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for taxpayers to claim qualified adoption expenses. It is to be attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. The form consists of three parts.

Part I requires the taxpayer to provide information about their eligible child or children, including their names, years of birth, whether they were born before 2005 and disabled, a child with special needs, or a foreign child.

Part II is for calculating the adoption credit. It includes fields for entering the maximum adoption credit per child, whether Form 8839 was filed for a prior year for the same child, and the calculation of qualified adoption expenses. The taxpayer is also required to enter their modified adjusted gross income and determine if it exceeds a certain threshold.

Part III is for reporting employer-provided adoption benefits. It includes fields for entering the maximum exclusion per child, whether employer-provided adoption benefits were received for a prior year for the same child, and the calculation of excluded and taxable benefits.

The form provides instructions and references to additional worksheets for further calculations and guidance.

Overall, Form 8839 is used by taxpayers to claim adoption-related tax benefits and report relevant information to the IRS.
