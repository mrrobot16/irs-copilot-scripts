Form 8904 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that is used to claim the Credit for Oil and Gas Production From Marginal Wells. The form requires the taxpayer to enter their qualified natural gas production and the credit amount for that production. The form also includes reserved sections for future use and a section for partnerships and S corporations to report their credit amount. The total credit amount is calculated by multiplying the qualified natural gas production by the credit amount. The form should be attached to the taxpayer's tax return. The latest instructions and information for Form 8904 can be found on the IRS website.
