Form 1040-C is a U.S. Departing Alien Income Tax Return. It is not a final income tax return, but rather a form that departing aliens must file before leaving the U.S. It requires information such as the individual's personal details, including their social security number and passport or alien registration card number. The form also asks for information about the individual's status as a resident or nonresident alien, their trade or business in the U.S., and their plans to return to the U.S. It also includes sections for reporting income, deductions, and calculating the tax owed. The form must be filed along with the individual's final income tax return after their tax year ends.
