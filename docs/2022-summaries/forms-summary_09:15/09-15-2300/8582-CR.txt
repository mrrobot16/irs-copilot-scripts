Form 8582-CR is a document used by taxpayers to calculate and report passive activity credits. It is attached to Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1041 and is used to determine the limitations on the use of these credits. The form is divided into several parts, each corresponding to a different type of passive activity credit.

Part I is for credits from rental real estate activities with active participation. It includes columns for credits from Worksheet 1, prior year unallowed credits, and the total of these credits.

Part II is for the special allowance for rental real estate activities with active participation. It calculates the smaller of the total credits from Part I or the tax attributable to net passive income.

Part III is for the special allowance for rehabilitation credits and low-income housing credits for property placed in service before 1990. It calculates the smaller of the total credits from Part I or the tax attributable to the amount on line 14.

Part IV is for the special allowance for low-income housing credits for property placed in service after 1989. It calculates the smaller of the total credits from Part I or the tax attributable to the remaining special allowance.

Part V calculates the total passive activity credit allowed by adding the amounts from lines 6, 16, 30, and 36.

Part VI is an optional section for taxpayers who disposed of their entire interest in a passive activity and want to elect to increase their basis in credit property used in that activity by the unallowed credit that reduced their basis in the property.

Overall, Form 8582-CR helps taxpayers determine the limitations and allowances for their passive activity credits.
