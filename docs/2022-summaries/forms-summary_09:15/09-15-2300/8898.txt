It also asks individuals to indicate whether they are a U.S. citizen or resident alien and to provide information about their worldwide gross income. 

The form also includes sections related to the individual's presence in the United States or possession, their connection to the United States, foreign country, or possession, and the source of their income. It asks individuals to provide information about the dates they moved to or from the possession, the number of days they were present in the United States or possession, and whether they had a significant connection to the United States or earned income from U.S. sources. 

Additionally, the form asks individuals about their closer connection to the United States, foreign country, or possession, including the location of their tax home, permanent home, immediate family, automobile(s), personal belongings, and banking activities. It also asks individuals about their voter registration, homestead exemption, and the location of their personal, financial, and legal documents. 

The form concludes with sections related to the source of income, including whether the individual had an office in the possession, received compensation for personal services, manufactured an article for sale, or sold appreciated property.
