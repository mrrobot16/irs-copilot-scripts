Form 8814 is a document provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for parents to report their child's interest and dividends on their tax return. The form should be attached to the parent's Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR. The form includes various sections for reporting the child's taxable interest, tax-exempt interest, ordinary dividends, qualified dividends, and capital gain distributions. It also provides instructions for calculating the tax on the first $2,300 of the child's interest and dividends. The form includes spaces for entering the child's name, social security number, and other relevant information. It is important for parents to consider whether filing a separate tax return for the child may result in lower taxes, as certain tax benefits may not be available if the parent chooses to report the child's income on their own return. The form includes instructions and guidelines for completing each section.
