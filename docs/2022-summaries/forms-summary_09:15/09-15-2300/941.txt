The form is divided into several parts, with Part 1 requiring information about the number of employees, wages, and tax withheld. Part 2 asks about the deposit schedule and tax liability for the quarter. Part 3 collects information about the business, including whether it has closed or stopped paying wages. Part 4 asks if a third-party designee is authorized to discuss the return with the IRS. Finally, Part 5 is for the signature of the person completing the form. The form also includes a payment voucher, Form 941-V, which should be completed if making a payment with Form 941. The form includes instructions and information about privacy and paperwork reduction.
