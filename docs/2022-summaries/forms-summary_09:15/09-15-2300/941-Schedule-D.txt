Schedule D (Form 941) is a document used by employers to report discrepancies in their tax returns caused by acquisitions, statutory mergers, or consolidations. The purpose of this schedule is to compare the totals reported on Forms 941 and Forms W-2 to ensure that the wages and taxes reported are accurate. This schedule should be used if there are discrepancies between the totals reported on these forms due to an acquisition, statutory merger, or consolidation. The schedule includes background questions about the type of transaction and the effective date, as well as a section to report the discrepancies in the returns. If there are multiple transactions, additional schedules can be filed.
