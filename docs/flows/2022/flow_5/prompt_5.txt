My client is a married couple based in New Orleans, Louisiana. They are filing taxes under married filing jointly status. 
The wife is the single member of an S corporation that she created in July 2021 for her wedding planning business. She specializes in planning South American weddings and travels at least 180 days out of the year to Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil. She pays taxes to these countries for the income she earns while she is working there.

The husband is self-employed and qualifies for active trader status. He also has a Robinhood account where he trades cryptocurrencies.

In 2021, the husband completed the couple’s tax return himself and purposely understated taxes due on their joint tax. The wife had no knowledge of this understatement and is considered an “innocent spouse.”

The couple purchased a property in Arkansas in February 2022 and have been renting it out to tenants the rest of the year. In 2022, they broke even on this property.
