My client is single and lives in San Francisco, CA. She is an only child and pays for all of the expenses related to her aging mother, including a day time nurse for when the client is working.

She earns $300k a year working for a startup as an employee. She joined this startup in 2022 and early exercised her incentive stock options in the same tax year.

As part of her employee benefits, the client has an HSA (health savings account) and withdrew funds from it in 2022. She also has a ROTH IRA through Fidelity and contributed the maximum amount ($6,000).

The client is a beneficiary of an irrevocable trust that owns and sells physical property. In addition, the trust owns a portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investment assets that are subject to capital gains tax.
